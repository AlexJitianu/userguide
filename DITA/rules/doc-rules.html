      <p class="p">The vast amount of rules that pertain to writing in the English language can be daunting,
        to say the least. There are also a lot of different opinions about which of those rules
        should be followed. There is a difference between the ability to speak in coherent and
        grammatically correct English and the ability to write effectively in English. Perhaps many
        of the common rules are not as important when it comes to verbal communication, but written
        documentation clearly needs to be consistent and follow a set of defined rules. It is also
        important to distinguish between concrete grammar rules that should always be followed and
        style rules that are simply guidelines or choices that will help make documentation to be
        more consistent and potent.</p>

      <p class="p">As a general rule for writing technical documentation, it is important to keep it as simple
        as possible while using enough creativity and solid writing skills to keep the reader
        engaged long enough to absorb whatever information they need to satisfy the reason they
        found the particular documentation in the first place. All talented writers have developed
        their skill over the course of time by writing <em class="ph i">A LOT</em>. However, following a set of
        rules and guidelines can help less experienced writers, as well as those without
        native-level language skills. Especially when documentation is written by multiple writers,
        it is important to have a common set of rules and guidelines to keep the documentation
        consistent, effective, and professional.</p>

            <dd class="dd">The following grammar rules are meant to distinguish when and how to use specific
              words or which form of a word to use in particular situations:<dl class="dl">

                    is written. The rule is that you use "a" before words that start with a
                    consonant SOUND and "an" before words that start with a vowel SOUND. The letters
                    'H' and 'U' usually cause the most confusion. Examples: 'Unique' or 'URL'- You
                    would use 'a' before both words because they both begin with a 'you' SOUND. On
                    the other hand, 'Unusual'- You would use 'an' before this word because it begins
                    with an 'uh' SOUND. 'Hour'- You would use 'an' because it begins with an 'a-wer'
                    SOUND. 'HTTP'- Also use 'an' because it begins with an 'aye' SOUND. 'Honorable'
                    begins with an 'o' SOUND. Conversely, 'Historic' would need 'a' in front because
                    it begins with a "h" SOUND.</dd>

                  <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong> â€¦ it is debatable as to whether this is a grammar rule or
                    a matter of style choice, but regardless, in most cases it looks and sounds much
                    better to use the common grammar rule that most people follow. To make a complex
                    topic as simple as possible, follow this rule- use "that" before a restrictive
                    clause and "which" before nonrestrictive clauses. A 'restrictive clause' is just
                    part of a sentence that you can not get rid of because it specifically restricts
                    some other part of the sentence. Here is an example of a 'restrictive clause':
                    Gems that sparkle often elicit forgiveness. The words "that sparkle" restrict
                    the kind of gems you are talking about. Without them, the meaning of the
                    sentence would change. A 'nonrestrictive clause' is something that can be left
                    off without changing the meaning of the sentence (simply additional
                    information). Here is an example of a 'nonrestrictive clause': Diamonds, which
                    are a type of gem, often elicit forgiveness. Alas, diamonds are always a type of
                    gem so leaving out the words "which are a type of gem" does not change the
                    meaning of the sentence. (Also note that the phrase is surrounded by commas.
                    Nonrestrictive clauses are usually surrounded by, or preceded by, commas.)</dd>

                    "either to" Greece or Italy.) When speaking, both phrases are acceptable.
                    However, when writing, example 1 ("to either") is more grammatically correct.
                    The word "either" implies a choice of two options and by placing the 'to' in
                    front you are removing it from the construction (either A or B). To use example
                    2 ("either to") you would need to write: "We could go either to Greece or to
                    Italy."</dd>

                  <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong> Using the word 'also' can become very complicated in
                    English grammar. USUALLY, you will place 'also' before the verb or between what
                    is called a modal verb (i.e. can, should, must, might, could) and a normal verb
                    (an example with one normal verb: "He also speaks Romanian"; an example with a
                    modal verb in front of a normal verb: "He can also speak Romanian"). Notice that
                    you do not place the 'also' after the verb 'speak'. That is grammatically
                    incorrect. There are many exceptions and sometimes you need to be aware that the
                    placement of the word 'also' can change the meaning of a sentence (for example,
                    "I will also go to Greece" implies that I will go to Greece along with some
                    other place, while "I also will go to Greece" implies that I will go to Greece
                    along with someone else). One common exception: Typically, you will only place
                    'also' after a verb if it is a simple sentence and the verb is a form of the
                    verb 'to be' (for example: "He is also Romanian"). Example from the website: "If
                    you rename a folder you can also update the references to the resources from
                    that folder." Originally, the 'also' was placed after 'update', which is
                    incorrect. NOTE: Sometimes it is more appropriate to avoid separating clauses,
                    in which case it is best to begin the sentence with 'Also,' (it should always be
                    followed by a comma in this situation). This places the 'also' completely
                    outside the idea or clause.</dd>

                  <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong> In most cases avoid using 'like' when you can use 'such
                    as' instead. "Like" suggests comparison (being similar to something) while "such
                    as" suggests inclusion (and example of). Example: "You can specify a set of
                    transformation scenarios to convert the XML documents to various formats, such
                    as HTML and PDF." You cannot use 'like' instead of such as because you are not
                    comparing formats to HTML or PDF. You are including them as examples. Here is an
                    example 'like' is used properly: "Your documentation might include a sentence
                    like the one in the following example:". You can use the word 'like' in this
                    case because it is implying that the hypothetical "sentence" is similar to the
                    one in the example that follows.</dd>

                    sound quite monotonous, and it is often perceived as being unprofessional and
                    irritating to the reader. Ultimately, it really depends on the type of writing
                    and it becomes a style choice.</dd>

                    sentences with common adverbs. However, this is not the case with conjunctive
                    adverbs. These adverbs are used as transitions between sentences, they often can
                    move almost anywhere in a sentence, and it is absolutely acceptable to begin a

                  comes across as sounding weak and ambiguous, while using in an active voice makes
                  your writing seem more alive and clear. Basically, passive voice happens when the

                  In other words, the object becomes the subject. For example, <em class="ph i">"I mailed the

                      <dd class="dd">Also, keep this in mind: All passive sentences include a form of the verb

                        not all sentences that have those verbs are passive. It is easy to recognize
                        sentences that include a form of <em class="ph i">"to be"</em> but you need to ask yourself
                        the two questions above to determine if it is in the passive voice.</dd>
