      <p class="p">The vast amount of rules that pertain to writing in the English language can be daunting,
        to say the least. There are also a lot of different opinions about which of those rules
        should be followed. There is a difference between the ability to speak in coherent and
        grammatically correct English and the ability to write effectively in English. Perhaps many
        of the common rules are not as important when it comes to verbal communication, but written
        documentation clearly needs to be consistent and follow a set of defined rules. It is also
        important to distinguish between concrete grammar rules that should always be followed and
        style rules that are simply guidelines or choices that will help make documentation to be
        more consistent and potent.</p>

      <p class="p">As a general rule for writing technical documentation, it is important to keep it as simple
        as possible while using enough creativity and solid writing skills to keep the reader
        engaged long enough to absorb whatever information they need to satisfy the reason they
        found the particular documentation in the first place. All talented writers have developed
        their skill over the course of time by writing <em class="ph i">A LOT</em>. However, following a set of
        rules and guidelines can help less experienced writers, as well as those without
        native-level language skills. Especially when documentation is written by multiple writers,
        it is important to have a common set of rules and guidelines to keep the documentation
        consistent, effective, and professional.</p>

                  <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong><dfn class="term">Conjunctive adverbs</dfn> are simply adverbs that
                    connect two independent clauses. They can sometimes move almost anywhere in a
                    sentence and they are usually used to link the ideas from two or more sentences,
                    but they can also be used to connect two independent main clauses in the same
                    sentence (although this is probably rare in technical documentation). Usually,
                    they are placed at the beginning of the second clause since it provides a
                    logical transition from one clause to the other. When used to connect two main
                    clauses a semicolon needs to be used between the first clause and the
                    conjunctive adverb, but again, this is rare in technical documentation. Most of
                    the time, the conjunctive adverbs need to be separated from the clause with one
                    or two commas.</dd>

                      words that start with a vowel. However, that is only partially correct.
                      REMEMBER, it is how the subsequent word SOUNDS, not how it is written. The
                      letters 'H' and 'U' usually cause the most confusion because some words that
                      start with those letters have a consonant sound and some have a vowel

                  <dd class="dd"><strong class="ph b">Description:</strong> An <dfn class="term">infinitive</dfn> is a two-word form of a verb,
                    such as <em class="ph i">"to read"</em> or <em class="ph i">"to understand"</em>. There is a common
                    misperception that you should not split infinitives, but there is actually
                    nothing wrong with doing so, although in technical writing it often means that
                    you are adding an unnecessary word. There are quite a few instances where using
                    split infinitives add meaning to a sentence. A common example is the phrase
                      <em class="ph i">"to better understand"</em>. Including the word <em class="ph i">"better"</em> certainly
                    adds some meaning. There are usually other ways to include these types of
                    powerful words without using them to split infinitives, but you also want to
                    avoid awkward sentences.</dd>

                      wrong with splitting infinitives, in technical writing, it is safer to avoid
                      them, if possible. However, you should also avoid creating awkward sentences
                      by trying too hard to avoid splitting infinitives. If you need to use an extra
                      word to add meaning and using that extra word to split an infinitive makes the
                      sentence less awkward than the alternatives, keep the split infinitive.</p>

                    sound quite monotonous, and it is often perceived as being unprofessional and

                      rules in regards to hyphenating compound adjectives:<ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li">Always hyphenate compound words that include hyphens in their dictionary
                          definitions. Examples: <em class="ph i">"right-click</em>, <em class="ph i">"double-click"</em>,
                            <em class="ph i">"built-in"</em>, <em class="ph i">"pop-up"</em>, <em class="ph i">"drop-down"</em>,
                          <em class="ph i">"on-site"</em>.</li>

                        <li class="li">Hyphenate compound adjectives whenever they are placed before a
                          noun.</li>

                        <li class="li">Do not hyphenate compound adjectives when they are placed after a noun,
                          unless they are hyphenated by definition.</li>

                        <li class="li">Do not hyphenate compounds that are formed with <em class="ph i">"ly"</em> adverbs,
                          even when they precede a noun they modify (for example, <em class="ph i">"fully
                            developed program"</em>)</li>

                        <li class="li">The most important thing is to avoid ambiguity, so if there is still a
                          question as to whether or not to hyphenate the compound words, it is
                          better to hyphenate them than the reverse.</li>

                        <li class="li">DO NOT hyphenate the following words: <em class="ph i">"plugin"</em>,
                            <em class="ph i">"screenshot"</em>, <em class="ph i">"checkbox"</em></li>

                      ambiguity and it is preferable to hyphenate words that would otherwise look
                      awkward. Based on that, in most cases, prefixes that result in two consecutive
                      vowels should be hyphenated.<ul class="ul">

          <dd class="dd">If you <em class="ph i">really</em> want to produce great documentation, it needs to be proofread and
            edited. No matter how talented a writer happens to be, it is nearly impossible to avoid
            mistakes on the first attempt.<div class="p"><strong class="ph b">Tips for proofreading and editing:</strong><ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">It is often a good idea to write all of your text, then take a break from it,
                  and return to proofread and edit it later with fresh eyes and ideas.</li>

                <li class="li">When proofreading your text, shorten, delete, and rewrite anything that does not
                  add to its meaning.</li>

                <li class="li">It is also a good idea to have someone else review your documentation because
                  when you read something you wrote yourself, you know what you <em class="ph i">meant</em> to
                  write, so it is really easy to just skip over typos or missing words.</li>

                <li class="li">If you are editing your own work, changing the indent structure or font size can
                  help you recognize mistakes that were previously unnoticed.</li>

                  <dd class="dd"><u class="ph u"><strong class="ph b">Rules or Suggestions:</strong></u> Particularly in technical writing, you
                    should avoid using a <dfn class="term">passive voice</dfn> whenever possible.
                      <dfn class="term">Passive</dfn> writing comes across as sounding weak and ambiguous,
                    while using in an active voice makes your writing seem more alive and clear.
                    Basically, passive voice happens when the object of a sentence is placed in the
                    beginning of a sentence instead of the end. In other words, the object becomes
                    the subject. For example, <em class="ph i">"I mailed the letter"</em> becomes passive if it is
                    changed to <em class="ph i">"The letter was mailed by me"</em>.<dl class="dl">
                      
                        <dt class="dt dlterm">How to recognize a <em class="ph i">Passive Voice</em> sentence</dt>

                        <dd class="dd">The two most basic things to ask yourself are:<ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li">Is the object in the subject position?</li>

                            <li class="li">Can I add <em class="ph i">"by [so-and-so]"</em> to the end?</li>

                          </ul>
</dd>

                        <dd class="dd">Also, keep this in mind: All passive sentences include a form of the
                          verb <em class="ph i">"to be"</em> (such as <em class="ph i">"was"</em>, <em class="ph i">"were"</em> or <em class="ph i">"is"</em>),
                          BUT not all sentences that have those verbs are passive. It is easy to
                          recognize sentences that include a form of <em class="ph i">"to be"</em> but you need to
                          ask yourself the two questions above to determine if it is in the passive
                          voice.</dd>

                    because they are stuck and need to figure out how to do something specific.

                    technical documentation needs to have a lot of structured markup to emphasize

                    for, without needing to read other content that may not be relevant to their
