      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The vast amount of rules that pertain to writing in the English language can be daunting,
        to say the least. There are also a lot of different opinions about which of those rules
        should be followed. There is a difference between the ability to speak in coherent and
        grammatically correct English and the ability to write effectively in English. Perhaps many
        of the common rules are not as important when it comes to verbal communication, but written
        documentation clearly needs to be consistent and follow a set of defined rules. It is also
        important to distinguish between concrete grammar rules that should always be followed and
        style rules that are simply guidelines or choices that will help make documentation to be
        more consistent and potent.</p>
      <p>As a general rule for writing technical documentation, it is important to keep it as simple
        as possible while using enough creativity and solid writing skills to keep the reader
        engaged long enough to absorb whatever information they need to satisfy the reason they
        found the particular documentation in the first place. All talented writers have developed
        their skill over the course of time by writing <i>A LOT</i>. However, following a set of
        rules and guidelines can help less experienced writers, as well as those without
        native-level language skills. Especially when documentation is written by multiple writers,
        it is important to have a common set of rules and guidelines to keep the documentation
        consistent, effective, and professional.</p>

            <dt>Common Grammar Errors</dt>
            <dd>The following grammar errors are some of the most common mistakes that are made
              while writing in general:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Incomplete Comparisons</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> When you are implying that something is being compared to
                    something else, you must always clarify what you are comparing it to. Otherwise,
                    it will be difficult for the reader to discern what the comparison actually
                    means.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Example of an error:</i></b>
                    <i>Our software is more powerful and efficient.</i></dd>
                  <dd><b>Problem:</b> The software is more powerful and efficient <b>than
                    what</b>?</dd>
                  <dd><b>Solution:</b> Simply finish the comparison. <i>For example: Our software is
                      more powerful and efficient than all other XML editors.</i></dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Dangling Modifiers</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> This happens when a descriptive phrase does not apply to
                    the noun that immediately follows it. In other words, a word or phrase that
                    modifies a word not clearly stated in the sentence.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Example of an error:</i></b>
                    <i>Before performing the merge, the target item needs to be ready for the
                      operation.</i></dd>
                  <dd><b>Problem:</b> It is unclear what is "performing the merge". Is this implying
                    that the user is performing the merge, or is the "target item", or maybe "the
                    operation"?</dd>
                  <dd><b>Solution:</b> To fix this problem, try rearranging the structure of the
                    sentence or be more specific. <i>For example: Before you perform the merge, make
                      sure the target item is ready for the operation.</i></dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Vague Pronouns</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> A pronoun should refer clearly to the word or words it
                    replaces (called the <term>antecedent</term>) elsewhere in the sentence or in a
                    previous sentence. Pronouns are words that take the place of a noun (such as
                      <i>"you"</i>, <i>"it"</i>, <i>"who"</i>, <i>"they"</i>,
                    <i>"everyone"</i>).</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Example of an error:</i></b>
                    <i>Maximize the reuse possibilities for keys in topics by reflecting different
                      values depending on <b>their</b> defined scope.</i></dd>
                  <dd><b>Problem:</b> What is <i>"their"</i> referring to? It probably referring to
                    the defined scope of <i>"keys"</i>, but with the way this sentence is written,
                    it could also be referring to the scope of <i>"topics"</i>, <i>"values"</i>, or
                    possibly even <i>"reuse possibilities"</i>.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Solution:</b> If more than one word could be the antecedent (or if no
                    specific antecedent is present) you should edit the sentence to make the meaning
                    more clear. <i>For example: Maximize the reuse possibilities for keys in topics
                      by reflecting different values depending on the defined scope of the
                    keys.</i></dd>

                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Sentence Fragments</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> Quite simply, a <term>sentence fragment</term> is a piece
                    of a sentence that is disconnected from the main clause and cannot stand by
                    itself as a complete sentence.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Example:</i></b>
                    <i>Because the URL alone might point to a different item than the one you want
                      and a peg revision is needed.</i></dd>
                  <dd><b>Problem:</b> This fragment does not express a complete thought. The
                    subordinating conjunction <i>"because"</i> is dependent upon an independent
                    clause that is missing in this sentence fragment.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Solution:</b> Every sentence must have at least one main clause and express
                    a complete thought. It is important to proofread your work carefully to identify
                    possible sentence fragments.</dd>

                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Misusing Homonyms</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> It is impossible for spell checkers to detect misused
                    homonyms. A <term>homonym</term> is a word that is spelled the same way as
                    another word but has a different meaning.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Examples of homonyms:</i></b>
                    <i>"affect"/"effect"</i>, <i>"illicit"/"elicit"</i>,
                      <i>"complement"/"compliment"</i>, <i>"obtain"/"attain"</i>,
                      <i>"personal"/"personnel"</i>, <i>"suit"/"suite"</i>,
                      <i>"principal"/"principle"</i>, <i>"write"/"right"</i></dd>
                  <dd><b>Problem:</b> The obvious problem with misusing homonyms is that your
                    content will have unintended meaning.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Solution:</b> Since spell checkers will not detect misused homonyms, you
                    need to proofread your work carefully. Also, if you are not completely sure
                    about the difference between certain homonyms, avoid using those words
                    entirely.</dd>

            <dt>Specific Grammar Rules in Regards to Adverbs</dt>
            <dd>There are a lot of rules that apply to adverbs in English writing. The following are
              some of the most important grammar rules in regards to adverbs:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Conjunctive Adverbs</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b>...often can move almost anywhere in a sentence and they
                    are often used as transitions between sentences, but they are not conjunctions
                    and cannot be used to join two sentences.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Examples of conjunctive adverbs:</i></b>...Accordingly, Also,
                    Consequently, For Example, For Instance, Furthermore, Hence, However, In Fact,
                    Instead, Likewise, Otherwise, Nevertheless, Therefore, Thus.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Rules to follow:</b></dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Position of Adverbs in a Sentence</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> There are so many complex rules for where to position
                    different types of adverbs within a sentence that it is not even worth
                    discussing most of them. Essentially, an <term>adverb</term> is a word that
                    modifies another word or phrase. In most cases, you should make sure the adverb
                    is placed as close to the word or phrase that it is modifying as possible and
                    you should always pay attention to how the placement of the adverb can change
                    the meaning of the sentence. For more specific rules in regards to the placement
                    of adverbs, the following website defines some very clear rules for various
                    situations: <xref
                      href="http://www.englishpractice.com/improve/position-adverbs-2/"
                      format="html" scope="external"/>.<dl>
                      <dlentry>
                        <dt><b><term>Focusing Adverbs</term> (<i>"also"</i>, <i>"only"</i>,
                              <i>"either"</i>, <i>"neither"</i>, <i>"just"</i>,
                            <i>"mostly"</i>):</b></dt>
                        <dd>For the purposes of our documentation, we should concentrate on making
                          sure certain <term>focusing adverbs</term> are placed in the proper
                          position because they represent the most common errors and improper
                          positioning of these adverbs can lead to sentences that are awkward or
                          where the meaning is unclear. Since focusing adverbs point to a particular
                          part of a sentence, the meaning conveyed often depends upon their
                          position. The adverbs <i>"also"</i> and <i>"only"</i> are the most common
                          examples that are used in our documentation.<p><b><i>"Only"</i></b> -
                            Consider how the placement of the word <i>"only"</i> changes the meaning
                            in the following examples:<ul>
                              <li><b><i>Example 1:</i></b>
                                <i><b>Only</b> John gave Paul one dollar.</i> [No one else besides
                                John game him a dollar].</li>
                              <li><b><i>Example 2:</i></b>
                                <i>John gave <b>only</b> Paul one dollar.</i> [John gave Paul a
                                dollar and no one else].</li>
                              <li><b><i>Example 3:</i></b>
                                <i>John gave Paul <b>only</b> one dollar.</i> [John gave Paul one
                                dollar and nothing more].</li>
                              <li><b><i>Example 4:</i></b>
                                <i>John <b>only</b> gave Paul one dollar.</i> [John did nothing else
                                besides giving Paul a dollar.]</li>
                            </ul></p><p><b><i>"Also</i></b> - Consider how the placement of the word
                              <i>"also"</i> changes the meaning in the following examples:<ul>
                              <li><b><i>Example 1:</i></b>
                                <i><b>Also</b>, John thinks that Paul should stop smoking.</i> [In
                                addition to other ideas, John thinks Paul should stop smoking.]</li>
                              <li><b><i>Example 2:</i></b>
                                <i>John thinks that Paul <b>also</b> should stop smoking.</i> [John
                                thinks Paul should stop smoking, along with other people.]</li>
                              <li><b><i>Example 3:</i></b>
                                <i>John thinks Paul should <b>also</b> stop smoking.</i> [John
                                thinks Paul should stop smoking, along with stopping other
                                things.]</li>
                              <li><b><i>Example 4:</i></b>
                                <i>John <b>also</b> thinks that Paul should stop smoking.</i>
                                [Someone else and John think that Paul should stop smoking.]</li>
                            </ul></p></dd>
                        <dd><b>Rules to follow:</b> Most of the time it is best to place focusing
                          adverbs in front of and next to the word or words they are modifying.
                          However, be aware that doing so will not always eliminate ambiguity.
                          Therefore, you have to also rely on the context and consider the meaning
                          of the sentence based upon the placement of the adverb. If you find it
                          difficult to decide where to place them, try rephrasing the sentence

            <dt>Specific Grammar Rules in Regards to Specific Words or Phrases</dt>
            <dd>The following grammar rules are meant to distinguish when and how to use specific
              words or which form of a word to use in particular situations:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt><b><i>"a"</i></b> vs. <b><i>"an"</i></b></dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> This is one of the most common errors made in English
                    writing. There is a common misperception that the rule is that you use
                      <i>"a"</i> before words that start with a consonant and <i>"an"</i> before
                    words that start with a vowel. However, that is only partially correct.
                    REMEMBER, it is how the subsequent word SOUNDS, not how it is written. The
                    letters 'H' and 'U' usually cause the most confusion because some words that
                    start with those letters have a consonant sound and some have a vowel
                    sound.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Rule to follow:</b> The rule is that you use <i>"a"</i> before words that
                    start with a consonant SOUND and <i>"an"</i> before words that start with a
                    vowel SOUND.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Examples for "a":</i></b>
                    <i>"<u>Unique</u>" or "<u>URL</u>" - You would use "a'" before both words
                      because they both begin with a 'you' SOUND.</i>
                    <i>"<u>Historic</u>" or "<u>High</u>" - You would use "a'" before them because
                      they begin with a consonant 'h' SOUND.</i>
                  </dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Examples for "an":</i></b>
                    <i>"<u>Unusual</u>" or "<u>Uumbrella</u>" - You would use "an'" before both
                      words because they both begin with an 'uh' SOUND.</i>
                    <i>"<u>Hour</u>" or "<u>HTTP</u>" - You would use "an'" before them because they
                      begin with an 'a-wer' and 'aye' SOUND, respectively.</i>

                  <dt><b><i>"That"</i></b> vs. <b><i>"Which"</i></b></dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> There are some experts who believe this is more of a style
                    choice than a grammar rule, but those people are completely ignoring the fact
                    that when these two words are used interchangeably they are usually two
                    completely different types of grammatical words (<i>"that"</i> being an
                    adjective in these instances, and <i>"which"</i> being a pronoun/determiner).
                    Some people might also argue that the rules are more complex and flexible than
                    the rules we will use, but it is important to keep the rules simple and for the
                    purposes of our User Guide, we use these two words in ways that are only
                    grammatically correct and clear if we follow the rules listed below. Also, in
                    most cases, it looks and sounds much better to use this common grammar rule.
                    )</dd>
                  <dd><b>Rules to follow:</b> To make a complex topic as simple as possible, use
                      <i>"that"</i> before a <term>restrictive clause</term> and <i>"which"</i>
                    before <term>nonrestrictive clauses</term>. A <term>restrictive clause</term> is
                    part of a sentence that you can not get rid of because it specifically restricts
                    some other part of the sentence and without the clause the meaning of the
                    sentence would change (or the sentence would be incomplete). A
                      <term>nonrestrictive clause</term> is something that can be left off without
                    changing the meaning of the sentence (or making it incomplete) and it is simply
                    additional information.<note type="important">Nonrestrictive clauses are almost
                      always surrounded by, or preceded by, commas. Therefore, whenever you use
                        <i>"which"</i> before a nonrestrictive clause, it should be preceded with a
                      comma.</note></dd>

                    the actions that are in both locations instead of understanding that the section
                    includes ALL the contextual menu actions (and that they are ALSO available in
                    submenus). The clause that follows <i>"that"</i> in this case is a
                    nonrestrictive clause that simply provides additional information. Therefore,
                    you should use <i>", which"</i> in this type of instance. </dd>

                    simple as possible, consider who or what is being described. Some experts say
                    that it is acceptable to use either word when describing a person, but it seems
                    to dehumanize the person when using <i>"that"</i> to describe a person.</dd>

                  <dd><b>Description:</b> This is one of those rules that differ depending on
                    whether you are speaking or writing. Both phrases mean exactly the same thing
                    and when speaking, both phrases are acceptable. However, when writing, <i>"to
                      either"</i> is simply MORE grammatically correct.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Rules to follow:</b> As a general rule, it is better to use <i>"to
                      either"</i> since the word "either" implies a choice of two options and by
                    placing the <i>"to"</i> in the front, you are removing it from the grammatical
                    construction <i>'either A or B'</i>. If you do use <i>"either to"</i>, you would
                    need to include a second <i>"to"</i> to make the construction grammatically
                    correct (<i>'either <u>to</u> A or <u>to</u> B'</i>).</dd>

                  <dd><b>Description:</b> This is another one of the most common problems found in
                    English writing. Many grammarians consider both to be acceptable, especially
                    when speaking, but when using them in writing, you should not use them
                    interchangeably because they have different implications. <i>"Like"</i> suggests
                    comparison (something is similar to something else), while <i>"such as"</i>
                    implies inclusion (something is precisely included as an example of
                    something).</dd>
                  <dd><b>Rules to follow:</b> In most cases, avoid using <i>"like"</i> when you can

                  <dd><b>Description:</b> These two words are often confused when referring to

                    common problems in formal and technical writing. When speaking, or perhaps in
                    colloquial writing, the two words are often used synonymously, but in formal or
                    technical writing it is important to differentiate between the two.
                      <i>"Different"</i> implies a comparison (<i>different</i> from what?), whereas

                  <dd><b>Description:</b> There are so many conditions to this rule that it seems
                    that many modern writers have decided that it is too complicated and not worth
                    their time to consider so they simply ignore all of them and never include
                      <i>"or not"</i> even when doing so leads to ambiguity. They justify this by
                    suggesting that the <i>"or not"</i> is implied when appropriate and is therefore
                    optional. However, this is clearly not always the case. Your meaning can easily
                    become unclear or ideas might seem incomplete if you omit <i>"or not"</i> in
                    many cases. In the very least, it might irritate your reader if they have to
                    pause and re-read the sentence, and its surrounding sentences, to decipher the
                    intended meaning.<p>Consider the following example: <i>Oxygen prompts you to
                        choose <b>whether</b> you want to paste the content as XML.</i> The intended
                      meaning could have been any of the following:<ul>
                        <li>Oxygen prompts you to choose whether you want to paste the content as
                          XML or something else. [In this case, the sentence and idea is incomplete
                          and you need to specify what that 'something else' is.]</li>
                        <li>Oxygen prompts you to choose whether you want to paste the content as
                          XML, or not at all. [In this case, it is imperative to use <i>whether or
                            not</i> to avoid breaking the flow and possible ambiguity.]</li>
                        <li>Oxygen prompts you to choose something that was previously mentioned,
                          regardless of whether or not you want to paste the content. [In this case,

            <dd>There are a lot of very complicated rules when it comes to using tenses in English
              writing. The proper use of tenses is important because improper use could lead to
              ambiguity and the intended meaning can be inadvertently changed if the wrong tense is
              used. Without making it more complicated than it needs to be, the following rules are
              simply guidelines for using tenses to help avoid glaring mistakes:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Consistency in Tenses</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> If you shift the tense of verbs from one tense to another
                    without a clear reason, it can confuse your readers. There are instances where
                    it is necessary to change tense, even within the same sentence, but it should
                    only be done when the reason is clear or to make things even more clear.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Rules to follow:</b> In general, keep tenses consistent within sentences
                    and paragraphs, avoid changing tenses when there is no time change for an
                    action, and if you do need to change tenses, make sure that there is a clear
                    reason for it and as always, avoid ambiguity.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Example:</i></b>
                    <i>Write the description of the problem that <b>was</b> encountered, <b>send</b>
                      it to our support team, and we <b>will reply</b> as soon as possible.</i>
                    Notice that past, present, and future tenses are used in the same sentence. The
                    reason for the switch to future tense (<i>"we will reply"</i>) is quite clear.
                    The part of the sentence that is in past tense (<i>"that was encountered"</i>)
                    could certainly be omitted without changing the meaning, but there is absolutely
                    nothing wrong with keeping it because it simply makes it even more clear.</dd>

                  <dt>Future Tense</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> In English grammar, future tense is not considered a true
                    tense because tenses express the time of a state or action and the future has
                    not yet happened. Obviously, you need to future tense when referring to
                    something that will clearly happen in the future, but in professional or
                    technical writing, using present tense (whenever possible) enhances your message
                    by making it more clear and precise.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Rule to follow:</b> Avoid future tense unless you are referring to
                    something that will specifically happen in the future and you cannot use present
                    tense in the specific context.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Example of when NOT to use it:</i></b>
                    <i>Our sample documentation framework <b>will be</b> very simple.</i> This was
                    an actual example from our User Guide. Notice how ambiguous this sentence is. It
                    will be simple when? Why is it not simple now? Does the user need to do
                    something to make it simple? Clearly, this sentence should be <i>"Our sample
                      documentation framework <b>is</b> very simple."</i></dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Example of when you should use it:</i></b>
                    <i>We <b>will reply</b> as soon as possible.</i> You have to use future tense in
                    this case because the action will very clearly happen in the future.</dd>

                  <dd><b>Description:</b> The <term>progressive tense</term> is formed with a form
                    of the helping <i>"to be"</i> verb, plus the present participle of a main verb
                    with an <i>"ing"</i> ending.  The use of progressive tenses is not grammatically
                    incorrect, but it requires the use of extra auxiliary verbs and makes your ideas
                    less precise, and possibly less clear. Particularly in technical writing, it
                    should only be used to refer to something that is very clearly an ongoing action
                    and present tense cannot be used in the precise context.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Rule to follow:</b> Simply avoid progressive tense unless it is absolutely
                    necessary.</dd>

                    <i>Oxygen <b>is changing</b> the way you edit documents.</i> This sentence
                    should be <i>"Oxygen <b>changes</b> the way you edit documents."</i> Notice that
                    the second version is more powerful and precise.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Example of when you should use it:</i></b>
                    <i>Unfortunately, you cannot minimize the dialog box while the operation <b>is
                        processing</b>.</i> In this instance, it is actually better to use
                    progressive tense since it is referring to the time period during an ongoing
                    event. You could replace <i>"is processing"</i> with <i>"processes"</i>, but the
                    progressive form is actually more clear and precise in this case. </dd>

            <dt>Common Grammar Rule Myths or Misperceptions</dt>
            <dd>Some English grammar rules are ambiguous and debatable. Various grammar guides and
              experts sometimes differ when it comes to certain rules. Most experts come to a common
              consensus in regards to many of these ambiguous rules, while others simply become
              style choices when there does not seem to be a common opinion. Some of these
              complicated rules have also evolved or changed over time and can therefore become
                misperceptions.<p>This section includes some of the most common misperceptions in
                regards to grammar rules:</p><dl>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Misperception: Do not start a sentence with conjunctions!</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> This is one of those rules in English grammar where most
                    people are taught that it is wrong, but most experts agree that it is acceptable
                    to do so. However, even though it is technically acceptable, it does not mean
                    that it should be done because it could lead to incomplete sentences, it can
                    sound quite monotonous, and it is often perceived as being unprofessional and
                    irritating to the reader. Ultimately, it really depends on the type of writing
                    and it becomes a style choice. For example, it is far more acceptable and common
                    in general writing than in technical writing.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Rules to follow:</b> In technical writing, it is only appropriate to begin
                    sentence with certain <xref href="#doc-rules/subordinating-conjunctions-li"
                      format="dita"><term>subordinating conjunctions</term></xref>, but never with
                      <xref href="#doc-rules/coordinating-conjunctions-li" format="dita"
                        ><term>coordinating conjunctions</term></xref>. In most cases, you do not
                    use a comma after a subordinating conjunction that begins a sentence and the
                    most important thing to remember is that you need to avoid sentence
                    fragments.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Examples of conjunctions that are acceptable to begin a sentence with
                        (as long as it does not lead to a sentence fragment):</i></b> Certain
                    subordinating conjunctions (<i>"after"</i>, <i>"although"</i>, <i>"as soon
                      as"</i>, <i>"before"</i>, <i>"even though"</i>, <i>"if"</i>, <i>"in case"</i>,
                      <i>"now that"</i>, <i>"once"</i>, <i>"since"</i>, <i>"though"</i>,
                      <i>"unless"</i>, <i>"until"</i>, <i>"when"</i>
                    <i>"whenever"</i>, <i>"while"</i>)</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Examples of conjunctions that you should NOT begin a sentence
                      with:</i></b> All coordinating conjunctions (<i>"and"</i>, <i>"or"</i>,
                      <i>"but"</i>, <i>"nor"</i>, <i>"so"</i>, <i>"for"</i>, <i>"yet"</i>), along
                    with some subordinating conjunctions (<i>"because"</i>, <i>"so that"</i>,
                      <i>"than"</i>, <i>"why"</i>). Again, the most important thing is to avoid
                    sentence fragments.</dd>

                  <dd><b>Description:</b> This rule is highly debated and often becomes a matter of
                    style choice, but it also depends on the type of adverb and proper punctuation
                    is important. An adverb describes, modifies, or provides more information about
                    a verb, and they usually end in <i>"ly"</i>. In general, you should not begin
                    sentences with common adverbs. However, this is not the case with conjunctive
                    adverbs. These adverbs are used as transitions between sentences, they often can
                    move almost anywhere in a sentence, and it is absolutely acceptable to begin a
                    sentence with most conjunctive adverbs as long as you use proper punctuation
                    (they should be followed by a comma).</dd>

                  <dd><b><i>Examples of conjunctive adverbs that are acceptable to begin a sentence

                  <dd><b>Description:</b> There is simply more to it than that. The rule is really
                    that you should not end a sentence with a preposition when the sentence would
                    mean the same thing if you left off the preposition. However, there are
                    instances where it is better to end a sentence with a preposition. Examples of
                    prepositions include: <i>about</i>, <i>above</i>, <i>after</i>, <i>below</i>,
                      <i>before</i>, <i>between</i>, <i>except</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>from</i>,

                  <dd><b>Rules to follow:</b> Do not end a sentence with a preposition if removing
                    it would not change the meaning. Also, it is better to end a sentence with a
                    preposition that cannot be removed than to make the sentence sound awkward

                    infinitives, although in technical writing it often means that you are adding an
                    unnecessary word. However, there are quite a few instances where using split

                <dd>Use a serial comma for 3 or more sentence elements. Do not use a serial comma
                  for 2 elements. In many cases, omitting the serial comma is ambiguous. Moreover,
                  in the very rare case where adding the comma is ambiguous, the sentence should be

                <dd><b>Description:</b> There are two conflicting style rules in regards to whether
                  punctuation goes inside or outside quotations, depending on whether you use
                  American or British English rules. Since we use very few quotation marks in our
                  documentation, it is unnecessary to go into extensive details about these rules.
                  Instead, in those rare instances where quotations are used, we will use a
                  simplified version of the American rules.</dd>
                <dd><b>Rules to follow:</b> Always place commas and periods inside the closing
                  quotations mark, while semicolons, colons, and dashes always go outside the
                  closing quotation mark. Avoid using other punctuation with quotations, or avoid

          <dd><b>Rules or Suggestions:</b> If you <i>really</i> want to produce great documentation,
            it needs to be edited. No matter how talented a writer happens to be, it is nearly
            impossible to avoid mistakes on the first attempt. It is also a good idea to have
            someone else review your documentation because when you read something you wrote
            yourself, you know what you <i>meant</i> to write, so it is really easy to just skip
            over typos or missing words. If you are editing your own work, changing the indent
            structure or font size can help you recognize mistakes that were previously
            unnoticed.</dd>

                              [Item 2], [Coordinating Conjunction] [Item

                      subordinating conjunction causes the clause that it appears in to become
                      dependent. Therefore, it will be a sentence fragment unless it is joined to an
                      independent clause.<p><i><b>Example of a fragment:</b> With this option in

                        is surrounded by a large amount of content. This helps the reader to quickly
                        find the procedure that they are looking for amongst blocks of other
                        content.</li>
                      <li>Only use <term>unordered lists</term> (<codeph>ul</codeph>) when steps do
                        not need to occur in sequence.</li>
                      <li>Always use <term>ordered lists</term> (<codeph>ol</codeph>) when the steps
                        must occur in a sequence and make sure the items are in proper order.</li>
                      <li>Each step in a procedure should be an action in the sequence.</li>
                      <li>If possible, eliminate steps that lack action. Instead, put informational
                        content after the action within a step, or put it outside the step (for
                        example, in a <codeph>paragraph</codeph> or <codeph>step
                        result</codeph>).</li>
                      <li>Use sub-steps rather than putting too many tasks within one step.</li>
                      <li>Clearly identify optional steps. For example, put the word
                          <i>"optional"</i> in parentheses at the beginning of the step.</li>
                      <li>Identify conditional steps with words such as <i>"if"</i> and
                          <i>"then"</i>.</li>
                      <li>Use an additional list within a list for branching steps, such as
                        alternative methods.</li>
                      <li>Edit and rewrite ambiguous steps. Proofread the entire procedure, or
                        better yet, have someone else read the procedure, and if there is any
                        ambiguity in any of the steps, the procedure needs to be revised. </li>

                  using a <term>passive voice</term> whenever possible. <term>Passive</term> writing
                  comes across as sounding weak and ambiguous, while using in an active voice makes
                  your writing seem more alive and clear. Basically, passive voice happens when the
                  object of a sentence is placed in the beginning of a sentence instead of the end.
                  In other words, the object becomes the subject. For example, <i>"I mailed the
                    letter"</i> becomes passive if it is changed to <i>"The letter was mailed by
                    me"</i>.<dl>
                    <dlentry>
                      <dt>How to recognize a <i>Passive Voice</i> sentence</dt>
                      <dd>The two most basic things to ask yourself are:<ul>
                          <li>Is the object in the subject position?</li>
                          <li>Can I add <i>"by [so-and-so]"</i> to the end?</li>
                        </ul></dd>
                      <dd>Also, keep this in mind: All passive sentences include a form of the verb
                          <i>"to be"</i> (such as <i>"was"</i>, <i>"were"</i> or <i>"is"</i>), BUT
                        not all sentences that have those verbs are passive. It is easy to recognize
                        sentences that include a form of <i>"to be"</i> but you need to ask yourself
                        the two questions above to determine if it is in the passive voice.</dd>
