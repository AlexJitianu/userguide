      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The vast amount of rules that pertain to writing in the English language can be daunting,
        to say the least. There are also a lot of different opinions about which of those rules
        should be followed. There is a difference between the ability to speak in coherent and
        grammatically correct English and the ability to write effectively in English. Perhaps many
        of the common rules are not as important when it comes to verbal communication, but written
        documentation clearly needs to be consistent and follow a set of defined rules. It is also
        important to distinguish between concrete grammar rules that should always be followed and
        style rules that are simply guidelines or choices that will help make documentation to be
        more consistent and potent.</p>
      <p>As a general rule for writing technical documentation, it is important to keep it as simple
        as possible while using enough creativity and solid writing skills to keep the reader
        engaged long enough to absorb whatever information they need to satisfy the reason they
        found the particular documentation in the first place. All talented writers have developed
        their skill over the course of time by writing <i>A LOT</i>. However, following a set of
        rules and guidelines can help less experienced writers, as well as those without
        native-level language skills. Especially when documentation is written by multiple writers,
        it is important to have a common set of rules and guidelines to keep the documentation
        consistent, effective, and professional.</p>

            <dd>The following grammar errors are some of the most common mistakes that are made
              while writing in general:<p>

                  <dlentry>
                    <dt>Dangling Modifiers</dt>
                    <dd><u><b>Rule:</b></u> Avoid <term>dangling modifiers</term> to ensure
                      descriptive words or phrases are clear.</dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><b>Description:</b> This happens when a descriptive phrase does not apply
                        to the noun that immediately follows it. In other words, a word or phrase
                        that modifies a word not clearly stated in the sentence.</p>
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><b><i>Example of an error:</i></b>
                        <i>Before performing the merge, the target item needs to be ready for the
                          operation.</i></p>
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><b>Problem:</b> It is unclear what is "performing the merge". Is this
                        implying that the user is performing the merge, or is the "target item", or
                        maybe "the operation"?</p>
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><b>Solution:</b> To fix this problem, try rearranging the structure of the
                        sentence or be more specific. <i>For example: Before you perform the merge,
                          make sure the target item is ready for the operation.</i></p>

                    <dd>
                      <p><b>Description:</b> When you are implying that something is being compared
                        to something else, you must always clarify what you are comparing it to.
                        Otherwise, it will be difficult for the reader to discern what the
                        comparison actually means.</p>

                    <dt>Misusing Homonyms</dt>
                    <dd><u><b>Rule:</b></u> Be careful with <term>homonyms</term> since spell
                      checkers will not detect them and avoid using them if you are unsure of which
                      one to use.</dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><b>Description:</b> It is impossible for spell checkers to detect misused
                        homonyms. A <term>homonym</term> is a word that is spelled the same way as
                        another word but has a different meaning.</p>
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><b><i>Examples of homonyms:</i></b>
                        <i>"affect"/"effect"</i>, <i>"illicit"/"elicit"</i>,
                          <i>"complement"/"compliment"</i>, <i>"obtain"/"attain"</i>,
                          <i>"personal"/"personnel"</i>, <i>"suit"/"suite"</i>,
                          <i>"principal"/"principle"</i>, <i>"write"/"right"</i></p>
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><b>Problem:</b> The obvious problem with misusing homonyms is that your
                        content will have unintended meaning.</p>

                    <dd>
                      <p><b>Solution:</b> Since spell checkers will not detect misused homonyms, you
                        need to proofread your work carefully. Also, if you are not completely sure
                        about the difference between certain homonyms, avoid using those words
                        entirely.</p>

                    <dt>Sentence Fragments</dt>
                    <dd><u><b>Rule:</b></u> Avoid sentence fragments by realizing that every
                      sentence must express a complete thought.</dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><b>Description:</b> Quite simply, a <term>sentence fragment</term> is a
                        piece of a sentence that is disconnected from the main clause and cannot
                        stand by itself as a complete sentence.</p>
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><b><i>Example:</i></b>
                        <i>Because the URL alone might point to a different item than the one you
                          want and a peg revision is needed.</i></p>
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><b>Problem:</b> This fragment does not express a complete thought. The
                        subordinating conjunction <i>"because"</i> is dependent upon an independent
                        clause that is missing in this sentence fragment.</p>
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><b>Solution:</b> Every sentence must have at least one main clause and
                        express a complete thought. It is important to proofread your work carefully
                        to identify possible sentence fragments.</p>

                      <p><b>Description:</b> A pronoun should refer clearly to the word or words it
                        replaces (called the <term>antecedent</term>) elsewhere in the sentence or
                        in a previous sentence. Pronouns are words that take the place of a noun
                        (such as <i>"you"</i>, <i>"it"</i>, <i>"who"</i>, <i>"they"</i>,
                          <i>"everyone"</i>).</p>

                    <dd>
                      <p><b>Problem:</b> What is <i>"their"</i> referring to? It is probably
                        referring to the defined scope of <i>"keys"</i>, but with the way this
                        sentence is written, it could also be referring to the scope of
                          <i>"topics"</i>, <i>"values"</i>, or possibly even <i>"reuse
                          possibilities"</i>.</p>

                    <dd>
                      <p><b>Solution:</b> If more than one word could be the antecedent (or if no
                        specific antecedent is present) you should edit the sentence to make the
                        meaning more clear. <i>For example: Maximize the reuse possibilities for
                          keys in topics by reflecting different values depending on the defined
                          scope of the keys.</i></p>

            <dt>Specific Grammar Rules in Regards to Conjunctions and Adverbs</dt>
            <dd>There are a lot of rules that apply to conjunctions and adverbs in English writing.
              The following are some of the most important grammar rules:<p>
                <dl>
                  <dlentry>
                    <dt>Coordinating Conjunctions vs. Subordinating Conjunctions</dt>
                    <dd><b>Description:</b> There are two types of conjunctions (coordinating and
                      subordinating) and they both can be used to join clauses. Various rules for
                      conjunctions can become very complicated.</dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><u><b>Rules to follow:</b></u> The most important things to remember are
                        how to punctuate both types and that subordinating conjunctions require more
                        than one clause to avoid a sentence fragment.</p>
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                      <ul>
                        <li><b>Coordinating Conjunctions</b> - A coordinating conjunction joins two
                          main clauses with equal emphasis, or connects any other grammatical unit.<ul>
                            <li><b><i>The seven coordinating conjunctions:</i></b>
                              <i>"and"</i>, <i>"or"</i>, <i>"but"</i>, <i>"nor"</i>, <i>"so"</i>,
                                <i>"for"</i>, <i>"yet"</i>.</li>
                            <li><u><b>Punctuation rules to follow:</b></u> There are three patterns
                              for punctuating <term>coordinating conjunctions</term>:<ol>
                                <li><b>Connecting two independent clauses</b> - When you connect two
                                  independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction, use a comma
                                  before the conjunction. {[Main Clause 1], [Coordinating
                                  Conjunction] [Main Clause 2]}<p><b><i>Example:</i></b>
                                    <i>"The sample document contains elements from various
                                        namespaces<b>, so</b> you need to use CSS Level 3 extensions

                                <li><b>Connecting two items (other than two main clauses)</b> - Do
                                  not use a comma. {[Item 1] [Coordinating Conjunction] [Item
                                        2]}<p><b><i>Example:</i></b>

                                <li><b>Connecting three or more items in a series</b> - Use a comma
                                  after each item (except for the last) and before the conjunction.
                                  {[Item 1], [Item 2], [Coordinating Conjunction] [Item
                                        3]}<p><b><i>Example:</i></b>

                        <li><b>Subordinating Conjunctions</b> - A subordinating conjunction
                          emphasizes the idea in the main clause more than the one in the
                          subordinate clause. Also, it causes the clause that it appears in to
                          become dependent. Therefore, it will be a sentence fragment unless it is
                          joined to an independent clause.<p><i><b>Example of a fragment:</b> With

                  <dd><b>Description:</b><term>Conjunctive adverbs</term> are simply adverbs that
                    connect two independent clauses. They can sometimes move almost anywhere in a
                    sentence and they are usually used to link the ideas from two or more sentences,
                    but they can also be used to connect two independent main clauses in the same
                    sentence (although this is probably rare in technical documentation). Usually,
                    they are placed at the beginning of the second clause since it provides a
                    logical transition from one clause to the other. When used to connect two main
                    clauses a semicolon needs to be used between the first clause and the
                    conjunctive adverb, but again, this is rare in technical documentation. Most of
                    the time, the conjunctive adverbs need to be separated from the clause with one
                    or two commas.</dd>

                        <li>More often than not, they should be followed by a comma, and if used in
                          the middle of a sentence, they should also be preceded with a
                            comma.<note>The word <i>"however"</i> is somewhat of a special case
                            since it can also be used as a normal verb that means <i>in whatever
                              way</i> or <i>to whatever degree</i> (for example, <i>"However you
                              decide to do it, ..."</i>). Regardless, whenever it is used as a

                  <dd><b>Description:</b> There are so many complex rules for where to position
                    different types of adverbs within a sentence that it is not even worth
                    discussing most of them. Essentially, an <term>adverb</term> is a word that
                    modifies another word or phrase. In most cases, you should make sure the adverb
                    is placed as close to the word or phrase that it is modifying as possible and
                    you should always pay attention to how the placement of the adverb can change
                    the meaning of the sentence. For more specific rules in regards to the placement
                    of adverbs, the following website defines some very clear rules for various
                    situations: <xref

                            where the meaning is unclear. Since focusing adverbs point to a
                            particular part of a sentence, the meaning conveyed often depends upon
                            their position. The adverbs <i>"also"</i> and <i>"only"</i> are the most
                            common examples that are used in our

                              ambiguity. Therefore, you have to also rely on the context and
                              consider the meaning of the sentence based upon the placement of the
                              adverb. If you find it difficult to decide where to place them, try
                              rephrasing the sentence entirely.</p>

                      that many modern writers have decided that it is too complicated and not worth
                      their time to consider so they simply ignore all of them and never include
                        <i>"or not"</i> even when doing so leads to ambiguity. They justify this by
                      suggesting that the <i>"or not"</i> is implied when appropriate and is
                      therefore optional. However, this is clearly not always the case. Your meaning
                      can easily become unclear or ideas might seem incomplete if you omit <i>"or
                        not"</i> in many cases. In the very least, it might irritate your reader if
                      they have to pause and re-read the sentence, and its surrounding sentences, to
                      decipher the intended meaning.<p>Consider the following example: <i>Oxygen
                          prompts you to choose <b>whether</b> you want to paste the content as
                          XML.</i> The intended meaning could have been any of the following:<ul>
                          <li>Oxygen prompts you to choose whether you want to paste the content as
                            XML or something else. [In this case, the sentence and idea is
                            incomplete and you need to specify what that 'something else' is.]</li>
                          <li>Oxygen prompts you to choose whether you want to paste the content as
                            XML, or not at all. [In this case, it is imperative to use <i>whether or
                              not</i> to avoid breaking the flow and possible ambiguity.]</li>
                          <li>Oxygen prompts you to choose something that was previously mentioned,
                            regardless of whether or not you want to paste the content. [In this
                            case, you would need a commas after choose and use <i>whether or not</i>
                            or <i>regardless of whether or not</i>.]</li>

                          to stop and re-read it simply because you left out a few extra words that

            <dd>There are a lot of very complicated rules when it comes to using tenses in English
              writing. The proper use of tenses is important because improper use could lead to
              ambiguity and the intended meaning can be inadvertently changed if the wrong tense is
              used. Without making it more complicated than it needs to be, the following rules are
              simply guidelines for using tenses to help avoid glaring mistakes:<p>

                      another without a clear reason, it can confuse your readers. There are
                      instances where it is necessary to change tense, even within the same
                      sentence, but it should only be done when the reason is clear or to make
                      things even more clear.</dd>
                    <dd>
                      <p><u><b>Rules to follow:</b></u> Follow these rules in regards to tense consistency:<ul>
                          <li>In general, keep tenses consistent within sentences and
                            paragraphs.</li>
                          <li>Avoid changing tenses when there is no time change for an action.</li>
                          <li>If you do need to change tenses, make sure that there is a clear
                            reason for it.</li>

                        same sentence. The reason for the switch to future tense (<i>"we will
                          reply"</i>) is quite clear. The part of the sentence that is in past tense
                          (<i>"that was encountered"</i>) could certainly be omitted without
                        changing the meaning, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with keeping it
                        because it simply makes it even more clear.</p>

                    <dd><b>Description:</b> In English grammar, future tense is not considered a
                      true tense because tenses express the time of a state or action and the future
                      has not yet happened. Obviously, you need to future tense when referring to
                      something that will clearly happen in the future, but in professional or
                      technical writing, using present tense (whenever possible) enhances your
                      message by making it more clear and precise.</dd>

            <dt>Common Grammar Rule Myths or Misperceptions</dt>
            <dd>Some English grammar rules are ambiguous and debatable. Various grammar guides and
              experts sometimes differ when it comes to certain rules. Most experts come to a common
              consensus in regards to many of these ambiguous rules, while others simply become
              style choices when there does not seem to be a common opinion. Some of these
              complicated rules have also evolved or changed over time and can therefore become
                misperceptions.<p>This section includes some of the most common misperceptions in
                regards to grammar rules:</p><dl>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Misperception: Do not end a sentence with a preposition.</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> There is simply more to it than that. The rule is really
                    that you should not end a sentence with a preposition when the sentence would
                    mean the same thing if you left off the preposition. However, there are
                    instances where it is better to end a sentence with a preposition. Examples of
                    prepositions include: <i>about</i>, <i>above</i>, <i>after</i>, <i>below</i>,
                      <i>before</i>, <i>between</i>, <i>except</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>from</i>,
                      <i>in</i>, <i>off</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>onto</i>, <i>out</i>, <i>to</i>,
                      <i>until</i>, <i>with</i>, <i>without</i>.</dd>
                  <dd>
                    <p><u><b>Rules to follow:</b></u> Do not end a sentence with a preposition if
                      removing it would not change the meaning. Also, it is better to end a sentence
                      with a preposition that cannot be removed than to make the sentence sound
                      awkward trying to avoid it.</p>

                  <dt>Misperception: Do not split infinitives.</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> An <term>infinitive</term> is a two-word form of a verb,
                    such as <i>"to read"</i> or <i>"to understand"</i>. There is a common
                    misperception that you should not split infinitives, but there is actually
                    nothing wrong with doing so, although in technical writing it often means that
                    you are adding an unnecessary word. There are quite a few instances where using
                    split infinitives add meaning to a sentence. A common example is the phrase
                      <i>"to better understand"</i>. Including the word <i>"better"</i> certainly
                    adds some meaning. There are usually other ways to include these types of
                    powerful words without using them to split infinitives, but you also want to
                    avoid awkward sentences.</dd>
                  <dd>
                    <p><u><b>Rules to follow:</b></u> Even though there is nothing grammatically
                      wrong with splitting infinitives, in technical writing, it is safer to avoid
                      them, if possible. However, you should also avoid creating awkward sentences
                      by trying too hard to avoid splitting infinitives. If you need to use an extra
                      word to add meaning and using that extra word to split an infinitive makes the
                      sentence less awkward than the alternatives, keep the split infinitive.</p>

                  <dd><b>Description:</b> This is one of those rules in English grammar where most
                    people are taught that it is wrong, but most experts agree that it is acceptable

                    that it should be done because it could lead to incomplete sentences, it can
                    sound quite monotonous, and it is often perceived as being unprofessional and

                    against it and if you can say what you need to say in a single sentence that
                    lacks a direct connection with other sentences, it is better to stop there and

                      some sort of logical connection, but you also do not want the paragraphs to be
                      so long that your readers feel like they are facing an endless wall of text
                      and skip important information. There is nothing wrong with only including one
                      sentence in a paragraph, especially in technical writing, but you also do not
                      want to arbitrarily create multiple, sequential paragraphs with a single
                      sentence when their ideas are clearly connected.</p>

      or wrong ways to choose style rules. However, it is important to be consistent with style
      choices to make documentation readable and appealing. You certainly do not want to irritate
      your audience by using multiple, inconsistent, and incompatible styles.<p>To maintain

                  <dt>Possession</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> Normally, in English writing, you indicate possession for
                    a singular noun with an apostrophe plus the letter <i>"s"</i>. It can be a bit
                    complicated when dealing with nouns that end in an <i>"s"</i> (plural or
                    singular) and it can sometimes lead to confusion. However, in technical writing,
                    it is better to avoid using possession to avoid any possibility of confusion. In
                    most instances, there is an alternate way of writing sentences that might
                    include words that show possession. While these alternate ways might sometimes
                    seem overly formal for general writing or spoken communication, in technical
                    writing, not only are they acceptable, but they are actually preferred because
                    the more formal ways of writing the sentences are usually considered to be more
                    professional and more grammatically correct. </dd>
                  <dd>
                    <p><u><b>Rule:</b></u> Avoid using possessives in the User Guide, if at all
                      possible. If you find yourself using an apostrophe to show possession, rewrite
                      the sentence. There might be some rare cases where you cannot find a better
                      ways of writing the sentence and in those cases, use an apostrophe plus
                        <i>"s"</i> at the end of singular nouns and just an apostrophe at the end of
                      words that end in <i>"s"</i> (plural or singular).</p>

                    difficult one to define because there are a lot of different opinions about it
                    among experts and there does not seem to be a consensus for how they should be
                    written. The problem is that there are a variety of ways that acronyms are read
                    and deciphered and there is a lot of different opinions about which method looks
                    the best and which methods cause the most ambiguity. The rules that were chosen

                          apostrophes, in our documentation, we certainly do not want to cause
                          confusion by using them to signify a plural acronym.</li>

                      <term>Oxford comma</term>) is a comma that is placed immediately before
                    coordinating conjunctions (<i>"and"</i>, <i>"or</i>) in a series of three or
                    more items. In other words, it is the comma that comes before the final item in
                    the series. This is just a style rule and some writers choose to always include
                    the serial comma, while others choose to never include it. The important thing
                    is to always be consistent. However, omitting the serial comma can sometimes
                    leads to ambiguity, especially in complex sentences, so it seems more logical to
                    always include it rather than always omitting it.</dd>

                      because the content after that conjunction is not part of the series of items

                        <i>etc.</i>), but it actually still applies in that case because you would

                  <dd><b>Description:</b> There are a lot of complicated rules in regards to using
                    hyphens and they depend on the type of word or words in question. Fortunately,
                    there are really only two types of instances that we need to focus on for our
                    documentation since all other possible instances would be very rare in our style
                    of technical writing. In our case, the two types of words that require rules for
                    hyphens are <term>compound adjectives</term> and <term>prefixes</term>.</dd>
                  <dd>
                    <p><u><b>Rules for <term>compound adjectives</term>:</b></u>
                      <term>Compound adjectives</term> are two or more words that are combined to
                      make an adjective and therefore describe a noun or noun phrase. Follow these
                      rules in regards to hyphenating compound adjectives:<ul>
                        <li>Always hyphenate compound words that include hyphens in their dictionary
                          definitions. Examples: <i>"right-click</i>, <i>"double-click"</i>,
                            <i>"built-in"</i>, <i>"pop-up"</i>, <i>"drop-down"</i>,
                          <i>"on-site"</i>.</li>
                        <li>Hyphenate compound adjectives whenever they are placed before a
                          noun.</li>
                        <li>Do not hyphenate compound adjectives when they are placed after a noun,
                          unless they are hyphenated by definition.</li>
                        <li>Do not hyphenate compounds that are formed with <i>"ly"</i> adverbs,
                          even when they precede a noun they modify (for example, <i>"fully
                            developed program"</i>)</li>
                        <li>The most important thing is to avoid ambiguity, so if there is still a
                          question as to whether or not to hyphenate the compound words, it is
                          better to hyphenate them than the reverse.</li>
                        <li>DO NOT hyphenate the following words: <i>"plugin"</i>,
                            <i>"screenshot"</i>, <i>"checkbox"</i></li>
                      </ul></p>

                  <dd>
                    <p><u><b>Rules for <term>prefixes</term>:</b></u> When it comes to hyphenating
                      prefixes, it is completely a style choice, but it is important to avoid
                      ambiguity and it is preferable to hyphenate words that would otherwise look
                      awkward. Based on that, in most cases, prefixes that result in two consecutive
                      vowels should be hyphenated.<ul>
                        <li><b>Examples of prefixes to hyphenate:</b>
                          <i>"co-exist"</i>, <i>"co-owner"</i>, <i>"re-enable"</i>,
                            <i>"re-executing"</i>, <i>"re-engineering"</i>, <i>"re-evaluate"</i>,
                          and ALL words that use the <i>"non-"</i> prefix.</li>

          <dt>Good Documentation Requires Relentless Editing</dt>
          <dd>If you <i>really</i> want to produce great documentation, it needs to be proofread and
            edited. No matter how talented a writer happens to be, it is nearly impossible to avoid
            mistakes on the first attempt.<p><b>Tips for proofreading and editing:</b><ul>
                <li>It is often a good idea to write all of your text, then take a break from it,
                  and return to proofread and edit it later with fresh eyes and ideas.</li>
                <li>When proofreading your text, shorten, delete, and rewrite anything that does not
                  add to its meaning.</li>
                <li>It is also a good idea to have someone else review your documentation because
                  when you read something you wrote yourself, you know what you <i>meant</i> to
                  write, so it is really easy to just skip over typos or missing words.</li>
                <li>If you are editing your own work, changing the indent structure or font size can
                  help you recognize mistakes that were previously unnoticed.</li>

                    should be to provide all the necessary information in the most precise and
                    effective manner possible. There are times when it is good to use redundancy for
                    emphasis, but in all other situations it is best to avoid it.</dd>

                        <li><i>"add an additional"</i> - The word <i>"additional"</i> is
                          redundant.</li>
                        <li><i>"during the course of"</i> - The words <i>"course of"</i> are
                          repetitive.</li>
                        <li><i>"end result"</i> - The word <i>"end"</i> is not needed.</li>
                        <li><i>"final outcome"</i> - The word <i>"final"</i> is repetitive.</li>
                        <li><i>"in order to"</i> - The words <i>"in order"</i> are not needed.</li>
                        <li><i>"merge together"</i> - The word <i>"together"</i> is redundant.</li>
                        <li><i>"since the time you last"</i> - You can omit <i>"the time"</i> and
                          just use <i>"since you last</i>. This also applies without the word
                            <i>"last"</i>. For example, <i>"since the time you opened the file"</i>
                          should be <i>"since you last opened the file"</i>.</li>
                        <li><i>"still remains"</i> - The word <i>"still"</i> is unnecessary.</li>
                        <li><i>"unintentional mistake"</i> - All mistakes are
                          <i>"unintentional"</i>, so that word is redundant.</li>
                        <li><i>"variety of different"</i> - If there is a variety of something, it
                          is implied that they are different, thus <i>"different"</i> is
                          redundant.</li>

                      <u><b>Rules or Suggestions:</b></u> One of the most important things in
                      technical writing is to make sure the information that you write is very
                      clear. Use the following rules to help avoid confusion:<ul>
                        <li>Always proofread your writing carefully to identify possible
                          ambiguity.</li>
                        <li>It is also always a good idea to have someone else proofread your
                          writing because it may seem clear to you, but if it is ambiguous to them,
                          in any way, then it is probably also ambiguous to your normal
                          audience.</li>
                        <li>Be careful when using pronouns (<i>"this</i>, <i>"these"</i>,
                            <i>"it"</i>). Always ask yourself if there is any chance that the reader
                          will not know exactly what items the pronouns are referencing. See the

                  <dd><u><b>Rules or Suggestions:</b></u> Particularly in technical writing, you
                    should avoid using a <term>passive voice</term> whenever possible.
                      <term>Passive</term> writing comes across as sounding weak and ambiguous,
                    while using in an active voice makes your writing seem more alive and clear.
                    Basically, passive voice happens when the object of a sentence is placed in the
                    beginning of a sentence instead of the end. In other words, the object becomes
                    the subject. For example, <i>"I mailed the letter"</i> becomes passive if it is
                    changed to <i>"The letter was mailed by me"</i>.<dl>
                      <dlentry>
                        <dt>How to recognize a <i>Passive Voice</i> sentence</dt>
                        <dd>The two most basic things to ask yourself are:<ul>
                            <li>Is the object in the subject position?</li>
                            <li>Can I add <i>"by [so-and-so]"</i> to the end?</li>
                          </ul></dd>
                        <dd>Also, keep this in mind: All passive sentences include a form of the
                          verb <i>"to be"</i> (such as <i>"was"</i>, <i>"were"</i> or <i>"is"</i>),
                          BUT not all sentences that have those verbs are passive. It is easy to
                          recognize sentences that include a form of <i>"to be"</i> but you need to
                          ask yourself the two questions above to determine if it is in the passive
                          voice.</dd>

                      Likewise, paragraphs should also as short as possible because our brains take

                            result</codeph>).</li>
                        <li>Use sub-steps rather than putting too many tasks within one step.</li>
                        <li>Clearly identify optional steps. For example, put the word
                            <i>"optional"</i> in parentheses at the beginning of the step.</li>
                        <li>Identify conditional steps with words such as <i>"if"</i> and
                            <i>"then"</i>.</li>
                        <li>Use an additional list within a list for branching steps, such as
                          alternative methods.</li>
                        <li>Edit and rewrite ambiguous steps. Proofread the entire procedure, or
                          better yet, have someone else read the procedure, and if there is any
                          ambiguity in any of the steps, the procedure needs to be revised. </li>
