      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The vast amount of rules that pertain to writing in the English language can be daunting,
        to say the least. There are also a lot of different opinions about which of those rules
        should be followed. There is a difference between the ability to speak in coherent and
        grammatically correct English and the ability to write effectively in English. Perhaps many
        of the common rules are not as important when it comes to verbal communication, but written
        documentation clearly needs to be consistent and follow a set of defined rules. It is also
        important to distinguish between concrete grammar rules that should always be followed and
        style rules that are simply guidelines or choices that will help make documentation to be
        more consistent and potent.</p>
      <p>As a general rule for writing technical documentation, it is important to keep it as simple
        as possible while using enough creativity and solid writing skills to keep the reader
        engaged long enough to absorb whatever information they need to satisfy the reason they
        found the particular documentation in the first place. All talented writers have developed
        their skill over the course of time by writing <i>A LOT</i>. However, following a set of
        rules and guidelines can help less experienced writers, as well as those without
        native-level language skills. Especially when documentation is written by multiple writers,
        it is important to have a common set of rules and guidelines to keep the documentation
        consistent, effective, and professional.</p>

            <dt>Common Grammar Errors</dt>
            <dd>The following grammar errors are some of the most common mistakes that are made
              while writing in general:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Incomplete Comparisons</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> When you are implying that something is being compared to
                    something else, you must always clarify what you are comparing it to. Otherwise,
                    it will be difficult for the reader to discern what the comparison actually
                    means.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Example of an error:</i></b>
                    <i>Our software is more powerful and efficient.</i></dd>
                  <dd><b>Problem:</b> The software is more powerful and efficient <b>than
                    what</b>?</dd>
                  <dd><b>Solution:</b> Simply finish the comparison. <i>For example: Our software is
                      more powerful and efficient than all other XML editors.</i></dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Dangling Modifiers</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> This happens when a descriptive phrase does not apply to
                    the noun that immediately follows it. In other words, a word or phrase that
                    modifies a word not clearly stated in the sentence.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Example of an error:</i></b>
                    <i>Before performing the merge, the target item needs to be ready for the
                      operation.</i></dd>
                  <dd><b>Problem:</b> It is unclear what is "performing the merge". Is this implying
                    that the user is performing the merge, or is the "target item", or maybe "the
                    operation"?</dd>
                  <dd><b>Solution:</b> To fix this problem, try rearranging the structure of the
                    sentence or be more specific. <i>For example: Before you perform the merge, make
                      sure the target item is ready for the operation.</i></dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Vague Pronouns</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> A pronoun should refer clearly to the word or words it
                    replaces (called the <term>antecedent</term>) elsewhere in the sentence or in a
                    previous sentence. Pronouns are words that take the place of a noun (such as
                      <i>"you"</i>, <i>"it"</i>, <i>"who"</i>, <i>"they"</i>,
                    <i>"everyone"</i>).</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Example of an error:</i></b>
                    <i>Maximize the reuse possibilities for keys in topics by reflecting different
                      values depending on <b>their</b> defined scope.</i></dd>
                  <dd><b>Problem:</b> What is <i>"their"</i> referring to? It probably referring to
                    the defined scope of <i>"keys"</i>, but with the way this sentence is written,
                    it could also be referring to the scope of <i>"topics"</i>, <i>"values"</i>, or
                    possibly even <i>"reuse possibilities"</i>.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Solution:</b> If more than one word could be the antecedent (or if no
                    specific antecedent is present) you should edit the sentence to make the meaning
                    more clear. <i>For example: Maximize the reuse possibilities for keys in topics
                      by reflecting different values depending on the defined scope of the
                    keys.</i></dd>

                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Sentence Fragments</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> Quite simply, a <term>sentence fragment</term> is a piece
                    of a sentence that is disconnected from the main clause and cannot stand by
                    itself as a complete sentence.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Example:</i></b>
                    <i>Because the URL alone might point to a different item than the one you want
                      and a peg revision is needed.</i></dd>
                  <dd><b>Problem:</b> This fragment does not express a complete thought. The
                    subordinating conjunction <i>"because"</i> is dependent upon an independent
                    clause that is missing in this sentence fragment.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Solution:</b> Every sentence must have at least one main clause and express
                    a complete thought. It is important to proofread your work carefully to identify
                    possible sentence fragments.</dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Misusing Homonyms</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> It is impossible for spell checkers to detect misused
                    homonyms. A <term>homonym</term> is a word that is spelled the same way as
                    another word but has a different meaning.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Examples of homonyms:</i></b>
                    <i>"affect"/"effect"</i>, <i>"illicit"/"elicit"</i>,
                      <i>"complement"/"compliment"</i>, <i>"obtain"/"attain"</i>,
                      <i>"personal"/"personnel"</i>, <i>"suit"/"suite"</i>,
                      <i>"principal"/"principle"</i>, <i>"write"/"right"</i></dd>
                  <dd><b>Problem:</b> The obvious problem with misusing homonyms is that your
                    content will have unintended meaning.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Solution:</b> Since spell checkers will not detect misused homonyms, you
                    need to proofread your work carefully. Also, if you are not completely sure
                    about the difference between certain homonyms, avoid using those words
                    entirely.</dd>

            <dt>Specific Grammar Rules in Regards to Adverbs</dt>
            <dd>There are a lot of rules that apply to adverbs in English writing. The following are
              some of the most important grammar rules in regards to adverbs:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Conjunctive Adverbs</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b>...often can move almost anywhere in a sentence and they
                    are often used as transitions between sentences, but they are not conjunctions
                    and cannot be used to join two sentences.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Examples of conjunctive adverbs:</i></b>...Accordingly, Also,
                    Consequently, For Example, For Instance, Furthermore, Hence, However, In Fact,
                    Instead, Likewise, Otherwise, Nevertheless, Therefore, Thus.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Rules to follow:</b></dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Position of Adverbs in a Sentence</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> There are so many complex rules for where to position
                    different types of adverbs within a sentence that it is not even worth
                    discussing most of them. Essentially, an <term>adverb</term> is a word that
                    modifies another word or phrase. In most cases, you should make sure the adverb
                    is placed as close to the word or phrase that it is modifying as possible and
                    you should always pay attention to how the placement of the adverb can change
                    the meaning of the sentence. For more specific rules in regards to the placement
                    of adverbs, the following website defines some very clear rules for various
                    situations: <xref
                      href="http://www.englishpractice.com/improve/position-adverbs-2/"
                      format="html" scope="external"/>.<dl>
                      <dlentry>
                        <dt><b><term>Focusing Adverbs</term> (<i>"also"</i>, <i>"only"</i>,
                              <i>"either"</i>, <i>"neither"</i>, <i>"just"</i>,
                            <i>"mostly"</i>):</b></dt>
                        <dd>For the purposes of our documentation, we should concentrate on making
                          sure certain <term>focusing adverbs</term> are placed in the proper
                          position because they represent the most common errors and improper
                          positioning of these adverbs can lead to sentences that are awkward or
                          where the meaning is unclear. Since focusing adverbs point to a particular
                          part of a sentence, the meaning conveyed often depends upon their
                          position.</dd>
                        <dd>Consider how the placement of the word <i>"only"</i> changes the meaning
                          in the following examples:<ul>
                            <li><b><i>Example 1:</i></b>
                              <i><b>Only</b> John gave Paul one dollar.</i></li>
                            <li><b><i>Example 2:</i></b>
                              <i>John gave <b>only</b> Paul one dollar.</i></li>
                            <li><b><i>Example 3:</i></b>
                              <i>John gave Paul <b>only</b> one dollar.</i></li>
                            <li><b><i>Example 4:</i></b>
                              <i>John <b>only</b> gave Paul one dollar.</i></li>
                          </ul></dd>
                        <dd><b>Rules to follow:</b> Most of the time it is best to place focusing
                          adverbs in front of and next to the word or words they are modifying.
                          However, be aware that doing so will not always eliminate ambiguity.
                          Therefore, you have to also rely on the context and consider the meaning
                          of the sentence based upon the placement of the adverb. If you find it
                          difficult to decide where to place them, try rephrasing the sentence
                          entirely.</dd>

                      <dlentry>
                        <dt><b><i>Using Adverbs with Modal Verbs</i> (<i>"can"</i>, <i>"could"</i>,

                        <dd>A <term>modal verb</term> is a type of auxiliary verb that is used to
                          indicate the likelihood, possibility, necessity, or ability. Deciding how
                          to position adverbs in relation to model verbs can also become very
                          confusing, especially when the modal verb is used with another verb (such
                          a form of the <term>infinitive verb</term>
                          <i>"to be"</i>.</dd>
                        <dd>Consider the following examples:<ul>

                          to consider the awkwardness of the flow. There are a lot of exceptions to
                          this rule, but MOST of the time, you should use the following word order
                          when using this type of combination: <b><i>[Modal Verb] + [Adverb] +

            <dt>Specific Grammar Rules in Regards to Specific Words or Phrases</dt>
            <dd>The following grammar rules are meant to distinguish when and how to use specific
              words or which form of a word to use in particular situations:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt><b><i>"a"</i></b> vs. <b><i>"an"</i></b></dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> This is one of the most common errors made in English
                    writing. There is a common misperception that the rule is that you use
                      <i>"a"</i> before words that start with a consonant and <i>"an"</i> before
                    words that start with a vowel. However, that is only partially correct.
                    REMEMBER, it is how the subsequent word SOUNDS, not how it is written. The
                    letters 'H' and 'U' usually cause the most confusion because some words that
                    start with those letters have a consonant sound and some have a vowel
                    sound.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Rule:</b> The rule is that you use <i>"a"</i> before words that start with
                    a consonant SOUND and <i>"an"</i> before words that start with a vowel
                    SOUND.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Examples for "a":</i></b>
                    <i>"<u>Unique</u>" or "<u>URL</u>" - You would use "a'" before both words
                      because they both begin with a 'you' SOUND.</i>
                    <i>"<u>Historic</u>" or "<u>High</u>" - You would use "a'" before them because
                      they begin with a consonant 'h' SOUND.</i>
                  </dd>

                    choice than a grammar rule, but those people are completely ignoring the fact
                    that when these two words are used interchangeably they are usually two
                    completely different types of grammatical words (<i>"that"</i> being an
                    adjective in these instances, and <i>"which"</i> being a pronoun/determiner).
                    Some people might also argue that the rules are more complex and flexible than
                    the rules we will use, but it is important to keep the rules simple and for the
                    purposes of our User Guide, we use these two words in ways that are only
                    grammatically correct and clear if we follow the rules listed below. Also, in
                    most cases, it looks and sounds much better to use this common grammar rule.

                  <dd><b>Rules:</b>  To make a complex topic as simple as possible, use
                      <i>"that"</i> before a <term>restrictive clause</term> and <i>"which"</i>
                    before <term>nonrestrictive clauses</term>. A <term>restrictive clause</term> is
                    part of a sentence that you can not get rid of because it specifically restricts
                    some other part of the sentence and without the clause the meaning of the
                    sentence would change (or the sentence would be incomplete). A
                      <term>nonrestrictive clause</term> is something that can be left off without
                    changing the meaning of the sentence (or making it incomplete) and it is simply
                    additional information.<note type="important">Nonrestrictive clauses are almost
                      always surrounded by, or preceded by, commas. Therefore, whenever you use
                        <i>"which"</i> before a nonrestrictive clause, it should be preceded with a
                      comma.</note></dd>

                  <dd><b>Description:</b> Using the word 'also' can become very complicated in
                    English grammar. USUALLY, you will place 'also' before the verb or between what
                    is called a modal verb (i.e. can, should, must, might, could) and a normal verb
                    (an example with one normal verb: "He also speaks Romanian"; an example with a
                    modal verb in front of a normal verb: "He can also speak Romanian"). Notice that
                    you do not place the 'also' after the verb 'speak'. That is grammatically
                    incorrect. There are many exceptions and sometimes you need to be aware that the
                    placement of the word 'also' can change the meaning of a sentence (for example,
                    "I will also go to Greece" implies that I will go to Greece along with some
                    other place, while "I also will go to Greece" implies that I will go to Greece
                    along with someone else). One common exception: Typically, you will only place
                    'also' after a verb if it is a simple sentence and the verb is a form of the
                    verb 'to be' (for example: "He is also Romanian"). Example from the website: "If
                    you rename a folder you can also update the references to the resources from
                    that folder." Originally, the 'also' was placed after 'update', which is
                    incorrect. NOTE: Sometimes it is more appropriate to avoid separating clauses,
                    in which case it is best to begin the sentence with 'Also,' (it should always be
                    followed by a comma in this situation). This places the 'also' completely
                    outside the idea or clause.</dd>

                  <dd><b>Description:</b> In most cases avoid using 'like' when you can use 'such

                    transformation scenarios to convert the XML documents to various formats, such
                    as HTML and PDF." You cannot use 'like' instead of such as because you are not
                    comparing formats to HTML or PDF. You are including them as examples. Here is an
                    example 'like' is used properly: "Your documentation might include a sentence
                    like the one in the following example:". You can use the word 'like' in this

            <dt>Common Grammar Rule Myths or Misperceptions</dt>
            <dd>Some English grammar rules are ambiguous and debatable. Various grammar guides and
              experts sometimes differ when it comes to certain rules. Most experts come to a common
              consensus in regards to many of these ambiguous rules, while others simply become
              style choices when there does not seem to be a common opinion. Some of these
              complicated rules have also evolved or changed over time and can therefore become
                misperceptions.<p>This section includes some of the most common misperceptions in
                regards to grammar rules:</p><dl>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>Misperception: Do not start a sentence with conjunctions!</dt>
                  <dd><b>Description:</b> This is one of those rules in English grammar where most
                    people are taught that it is wrong, but most experts agree that it is acceptable
                    to do so. However, even though it is technically acceptable, it does not mean
                    that it should be done because it could lead to incomplete sentences, it can
                    sound quite monotonous, and it is often perceived as being unprofessional and
                    irritating to the reader. Ultimately, it really depends on the type of writing
                    and it becomes a style choice. For example, it is far more acceptable and common
                    in general writing than in technical writing.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Rules to follow:</b> In technical writing, it is only appropriate to begin
                    sentence with certain <xref href="#doc-rules/subordinating-conjunctions-li"

                        ><term>coordinating conjunctions</term></xref>. In most cases, you do not
                    use a comma after a subordinating conjunction that begins a sentence and the
                    most important thing to remember is that you need to avoid sentence
                    fragments.</dd>
                  <dd><b><i>Examples of conjunctions that are acceptable to begin a sentence with
                        (as long as it does not lead to a sentence fragment):</i></b> Certain
                    subordinating conjunctions (<i>"after"</i>, <i>"although"</i>, <i>"as soon
                      as"</i>, <i>"before"</i>, <i>"even though"</i>, <i>"if"</i>, <i>"in case"</i>,

                    is important. An adverb describes, modifies, or provides more information about
                    a verb, and they usually end in <i>"ly"</i>. In general, you should not begin
                    sentences with common adverbs. However, this is not the case with conjunctive
                    adverbs. These adverbs are used as transitions between sentences, they often can
                    move almost anywhere in a sentence, and it is absolutely acceptable to begin a

      your audience by using multiple, inconsistent, and incompatible styles.<p>To maintain
        consistency and visually appealing documentation, we will use the following <i>Style
          Rules</i> for the oXygen User Guide:</p><dl>

                  American or British English rules. Since we use very few quotation marks in our
                  documentation, it is unnecessary to go into extensive details about these rules.

          <dd><b>Rules or Suggestions:</b> If you <i>really</i> want to produce great documentation,
            it needs to be edited. No matter how talented a writer happens to be, it is nearly
            impossible to avoid mistakes on the first attempt. It is also a good idea to have
            someone else review your documentation because when you read something you wrote
            yourself, you know what you <i>meant</i> to write, so it is really easy to just skip
            over typos or missing words. If you are editing your own work, changing the indent
            structure or font size can help you recognize mistakes that were previously
            unnoticed.</dd>

                <dd><b>Rules or Suggestions:</b> Do not bury task-related information within dense
                  paragraphs. This will make your readers very frustrated when they are trying to
                  learn how to do a specific task. Use structured components to make your
                  instructions more visible and appealing. Follow the subsequent guidelines whenever
                  documenting procedures.</dd>

                  <p><b><u>Guidelines for documenting procedures:</u></b><ul>
                      <li>It is helpful to use titles for procedures, especially when the procedure
                        is surrounded by a large amount of content. This helps the reader to quickly
                        find the procedure that they are looking for amongst blocks of other
                        content.</li>
                      <li>Only use <term>unordered lists</term> (<codeph>ul</codeph>) when steps do
                        not need to occur in sequence.</li>
                      <li>Always use <term>ordered lists</term> (<codeph>ol</codeph>) when the steps
                        must occur in a sequence and make sure the items are in proper order.</li>
                      <li>Each step in a procedure should be an action in the sequence.</li>
                      <li>If possible, eliminate steps that lack action. Instead, put informational
                        content after the action within a step, or put it outside the step (for
                        example, in a <codeph>paragraph</codeph> or <codeph>step
                        result</codeph>).</li>
                      <li>Use sub-steps rather than putting too many tasks within one step.</li>
                      <li>Clearly identify optional steps. For example, put the word
                          <i>"optional"</i> in parentheses at the beginning of the step.</li>
                      <li>Identify conditional steps with words such as <i>"if"</i> and
                          <i>"then"</i>.</li>
                      <li>Use an additional list within a list for branching steps, such as
                        alternative methods.</li>
                      <li>Edit and rewrite ambiguous steps. Proofread the entire procedure, or
                        better yet, have someone else read the procedure, and if there is any
                        ambiguity in any of the steps, the procedure needs to be revised. </li>

                <dt>Avoid Passive Voice</dt>
                <dd><b>Rules or Suggestions:</b> Particularly in technical writing, you should avoid
                  using a <term>passive voice</term> whenever possible. <term>Passive</term> writing
                  comes across as sounding weak and ambiguous, while using in an active voice makes
                  your writing seem more alive and clear. Basically, passive voice happens when the
                  object of a sentence is placed in the beginning of a sentence instead of the end.
                  In other words, the object becomes the subject. For example, <i>"I mailed the
                    letter"</i> becomes passive if it is changed to <i>"The letter was mailed by
                    me"</i>.<dl>
                    <dlentry>
                      <dt>How to recognize a <i>Passive Voice</i> sentence</dt>
                      <dd>The two most basic things to ask yourself are:<ul>
                          <li>Is the object in the subject position?</li>
                          <li>Can I add <i>"by [so-and-so]"</i> to the end?</li>
                        </ul></dd>
                      <dd>Also, keep this in mind: All passive sentences include a form of the verb
                          <i>"to be"</i> (such as <i>"was"</i>, <i>"were"</i> or <i>"is"</i>), BUT
                        not all sentences that have those verbs are passive. It is easy to recognize
                        sentences that include a form of <i>"to be"</i> but you need to ask yourself
                        the two questions above to determine if it is in the passive voice.</dd>
