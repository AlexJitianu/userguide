  <body>
    <p><ph keyref="webapp"/> supports a <i>SharePoint</i> plugin that allows you to open documents
      from a SharePoint server by specifying the URL of the document. You can also browse the
      structure of a SharePoint folder by specifying its URL. To access these files, it is assumed
      that the <i>SharePoint</i> plugin is enabled in your installation of <ph keyref="webapp"
      />.</p>
    <p>You can access files stored in the following types of SharePoint servers:<ul>
        <li>On premise installation</li>
        <li>Office 365 (with or without ADFS authentication)</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>To open a file stored on a SharePoint server, use the dedicated <i>SharePoint</i>
      <uicontrol>Open Document</uicontrol> button in the <uicontrol>Open file</uicontrol> section of
      the main dashboard. If your connection has not yet been configured, a <uicontrol>SharePoint
        Login</uicontrol> dialog box will be displayed that allows you to specify the authentication
      credentials for the server.</p>
