  <title>Document Type</title>
  <body>
    <p id="document-type-definition">A <i>document type</i> or <i>framework</i> is associated to an
      XML file according to a set of rules. It includes also many settings that improve editing in
      the <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode for the category of XML files it applies for. These
      settings include:<ul>
        <li>a default grammar used for validation and content completion in both
            <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode and Text mode;</li>
        <li>CSS stylesheet(s) for rendering XML documents in <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol>
          mode;</li>
        <li>user actions invoked from toolbar or menu in <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode;</li>
        <li>predefined scenarios used for transformation of the class of XML documents defined by
          the document type;</li>
        <li>XML catalogs;</li>
        <li>directories with file templates;</li>
        <li>user-defined extensions for customizing the interaction with the content author in
            <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>The tagless editor comes with some predefined document types already configured when the
      application is installed on the computer. These document types describe well-known XML
      frameworks largely used today for authoring XML documents. Editing a document which conforms
      to one of these types is as easy as opening it or creating it from one of the predefined
      document templates which also come with <ph><ph keyref="product"/></ph>.</p>
