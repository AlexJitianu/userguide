    <!--XPath/XQuery Builder View Actions-->
    <p id="xpath-scope-menu"><uicontrol>XPath scope</uicontrol> menu - <ph><ph keyref="product"
        /></ph> allows you to define a scope on which the XPath operation will be executed. You can
      choose where the XPath expression will be executed:<ul>
        <li><uicontrol><image href="../../img/xpathScopeCurrentFile16.png"
            />Current file</uicontrol> - Current selected file only.</li>
        <li product="author developer editor"><uicontrol><image

          All the files in the project.</li>

            selected files</uicontrol> - The files selected in the workspace. The files are
          collected from the last selected resource provider view (<uicontrol>Navigator</uicontrol>,
            <uicontrol>Project Explorer</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Package
          Explorer</uicontrol>).</li>
        <li><uicontrol><image href="../../img/xpathScopeOpenedFiles16.png"

            />Working sets</uicontrol> - The selected working sets.</li>
      </ul>At the bottom of the scope menu there are available the following scope configuration
        actions:<ul>
        <li><uicontrol><image href="../../img/ConfigureSearchScope16.png"
            />Configure XPath working sets</uicontrol> - Allows you to configure and manage
          collections of files and folders, encapsulated in logical containers called <term>working
            sets</term>.</li>
        <li><uicontrol><image href="../../img/Filters16.png"/>XPath file
            filter</uicontrol> - You can filter the files from the selected scope on which the XPath
          expression will be executed. By default the XPath expression will be executed only on XML
          files, but you can also define a set of patterns that will filter out files from the
          current scope.<ph product="author developer editor"> If you select the <uicontrol>Include
              archive</uicontrol> option, the XPath expression will be also executed on the files in
            any archive (including EPUB and DocX) found at the current scope.</ph></li>
