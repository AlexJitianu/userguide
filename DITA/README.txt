Rules for writing the User Manual:


1. All images will be already scaled with GIMP or Photoshop when they are included in manual with an <image> element. This is necessary because if we add the image/@scale attribute the image will not be displayed correctly in JavaHelp. Also scaling it may make the text look bad at edges.

2. Maximum width of images: 820 pixels. Maximum height of images: 750. For larger width or height scaling is necessary in XML (the image/@scale attribute) or in PDF which will NOT be done.

3. Use "you" instead of "I", ex: "You should go to menu Options ..." instead of "I go to menu Options ...". Exception: the Common Problems chapter where the question is formulated as: "I get a crash on Mac OS X when I try to start Oxygen. What should I do?"
