    <p>In DITA, you create documents by collecting topics into maps. </p>
    <section>
      <title>DITA Maps</title>
      <p>A <xref keyref="dita.add-topic-to-map">DITA Map</xref> organizes a set of topics into a
        hierarchy. In most output formats, the structure of the map becomes the structure of the
        table of contents. <ph keyref="product"/> provides support for creating and managing DITA
        maps through the <xref keyref="dita.edit-maps"><wintitle>DITA Maps
        Manager</wintitle></xref>. </p>

      <title>Book Maps</title>
      <p>A <xref keyref="dita.book-map">book map</xref> is a specialized type of DITA map intended
        for creating the structure of a book. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Sub Maps</title>
      <p>You do not have to create an entire publication using a single map. It is generally good
        practice to break up a large publication into several smaller <xref keyref="dita.submaps"
          >sub maps</xref> that are easier to manage. You can include a sub map into a main map
        using a <codeph>mapref</codeph> element. You can reuse submaps in different publications by
        including them in different main maps. The <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle> provides
        support or creating and managing sub maps.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Chunking</title>
      <p>By default, many output types will place a single topic on each page. In some cases you may
        want to <xref keyref="dita.chunking">output multiple topics as a single output page</xref>.
        To support this, DITA provides the <codeph>chunk</codeph> attribute on a the
          <codeph>topicref</codeph> element in a map.</p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Validating a map</title>You should validate your maps to make sure that the
      individual topics are valid and that the collections between them are not broken. <ph
        keyref="product"/> provides a validation function for DITA maps that performs a
      comprehensive validation of a map and its topics. </section>
