        <p>Using a file explorer, go to the <ph
                keyref="product"/>
          <filepath>[OXYGEN_DIR]/frameworks</filepath> directory. Select the <filepath>sdf</filepath> directory
            and make an archive from it. Move it to another <ph
                keyref="product"/> installation
          (eventually on another computer). Extract it in the <filepath>[OXYGEN_DIR]/frameworks</filepath>
            directory. Start <ph keyref="product"/> and
            test the association as explained above.</p>
        <p>If you create multiple document type associations and you have a complex directory
            structure it might be easy from the deployment point of view to use an <ph
                keyref="product"/> All Platforms
            distribution. Add your framework files to it, repackage it and send it to the content
            authors.</p>
        <note type="attention">
            <p>When deploying your customized sdf directory please make sure that your sdf directory
                contains the <filepath>sdf.framework</filepath> file (that is the file defined as
                External Storage in Document Type Association dialog shall always be stored inside
                the sdf directory). If your external storage points somewhere else <ph
                    keyref="product"/> will not be able
                to update the Document Type Association options automatically on the deployed
                computers.</p>
