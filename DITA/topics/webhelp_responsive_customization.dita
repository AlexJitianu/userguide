      <title>Use one of the Predefined Placeholders to Insert Custom HTML Fragments</title>
      <p>The WebHelp Responsive template contains a series of component placeholders. Some of these
        placeholders are left empty in the default output configurations, but you can use them to
        display custom content. You can use this method when you like an existing skin, but you need
        to change a bit the generated output.</p>
      <p>The predefined empty
        <?oxy_comment_start author="bogdan" timestamp="20160415T105757+0300" comment="Schematic with the location of the empty placeholders."?>placeholders <?oxy_comment_end?>are:<ul>
          <li/>
        </ul></p>
      <p>Each such placeholder has an associated parameter in the
        <?oxy_comment_start author="bogdan" timestamp="20160415T105944+0300" comment="LInk to the Parameters tab"?>transformation
        scenario <uicontrol>Parameters</uicontrol> tab<?oxy_comment_end?>. As a means of rapid
        identification, all these parameters have the name prefix
        <codeph>webhelp.fragment</codeph>.</p>
      <p>For example, to insert a message above the search text field in the main page of the
        output, follow this procedure:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Edit the <term>WebHelp Responsive</term> transformation scenario.</li>
        <li>Go to <uicontrol>Parameters</uicontrol> tab and find the parameter associated with the
          place holder that you want to use. In our case, it is called
            <codeph>webhelp.fragment.welcome</codeph>.</li>
        <li>Edit the parameter. Depending on the size of the content you want to add you can insert
          one of the following:<ul>
            <li>a small well-formed XHTML fragment, such as: <codeph>&lt;i>Welcome to our user
                guide&lt;/i></codeph>.</li>
            <li>path to a file that contains a well-formed XHTML content.</li>
          </ul></li>
      </ol>

      <p>You can use this method when you like an existing skin, and it is very close to what you
        need, so it is the perfect candidate for customization. Such a situation could be when you
        want change a color, where you want to adjust a little bit the margins or paddings.</p>
      <p>Advantages</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>The custom CSS can be included in the project.</li>
          <li>Easy to setup.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Disadvantages</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>the fonts, images and other resources must be remote, on a server</li>
          <li>Does not appear in the <codeph>Themes</codeph> tab in the transformation scenario,
            instead it should be set as a parameter.</li>

    <section id="section_xmn_wpl_qv"><title>Create a WebHelp Responsive skin</title>This method is
      useful when you need some design that is not similar to any of the oXygen predefined skins, or
      you want to heavily change one of the skins. Also this method is useful when you want to
      distribute additional resources (font, images) together with CSS.<p>Advantages</p><p>
        <ul id="ul_ttt_qrl_qv">
          <li>The resources are encapsulated into the skin directory, together with the CSS
            file</li>
          <li>Appears in the transformation scenario dialog <codeph>Themes</codeph> tab.</li>

        <ul id="ul_uzj_trl_qv">
          <li>You need access to the installation folder, or to use an external DITA-OT, with the
            webhelp plugin installed.</li>
        </ul>
      </p><p>Method</p><p>First of all you have to locate the DITA-OT you are using. (Look into the
        preferences for "DITA"). For instance if you are using DITA-OT 2.X, look into the folder: </p><p>
        <codeblock>{oXygenInstallDir}/frameworks/dita/DITA-OT2.x/plugins/com.oxygenxml.webhelp/templates/dita/bootstrap/variants/</codeblock>
      </p><p>Here you can see some subdirectories, corresponding to different variants of the same
        template. For instance:<ol id="ol_fgc_vrl_qv">
          <li>tiles (the main page contains a section with tiles for each chapter)</li>
          <li>tree (the main page contains a section with some expandable tree)</li>
        </ol></p><p>In each variant, you will find a directory with a collection of
        skins.</p><p>Copy the folder of one skin and change the <codeph>skin.css</codeph>
        file.</p><p>You can place fonts, images or other resources in the
          <filepath>resources</filepath> folder next to the <filepath>skin.css</filepath>
        file.</p><p>Tip: Use a small map for a speedy publishing time. Use the browser CSS inspector
        to lookup for CSS classes you need to modify.</p></section>
