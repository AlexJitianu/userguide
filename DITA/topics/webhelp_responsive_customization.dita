            <entry>
              <p>Locate the DITA-OT you are using. (Look into the preferences for "DITA"). For
                instance if you are using DITA-OT 2.X, look into the folder: </p>

              </p>
              <p>Here you can see some subdirectories, corresponding to different variants of the
                same template. For instance:<ol id="ol_vr5_fxw_pv">
                  <li>tiles (the main page contains a section with tiles for each chapter)</li>
                  <li>tree (the main page contains a section with some expandable tree)</li>
                </ol></p>
              <p>In each variant, you will find a directory with a collection of skins.</p>
              <p>Copy the folder of one skin and change the <codeph>skin.css</codeph> file.</p>
              <p>You can place fonts, images or other resources in the
                  <filepath>resources</filepath> folder next to the <filepath>skin.css</filepath>
                file.</p>
              <p>Tip: Use a small map for a speedy publishing time. Use the browser CSS inspector to
                lookup for CSS classes you need to modify.</p>
