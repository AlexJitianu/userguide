        <p><ph keyref="product"/> lets you <xref keyref="author.change-tracking">enter review
        comments and track changes</xref> in your documents. The Review preferences control how the
        <ph keyref="product"/> review features work. To configure the <uicontrol>Review</uicontrol>
      options, <ph conkeyref="reusable.menus/open-the-preferences-page"/> and go to <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Editor</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Edit modes</uicontrol>

      </menucascade>.</p>
        <p>The available options are:</p>
        <ul>
      <li><uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> - Specifies the name to be attached to all comments and to
        changes made while <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> is active.
        <?oxy_comment_start author="Mark" timestamp="20140901T161632-0400" comment="This appears to default to the system user name. Correct?"?></li>
      <?oxy_comment_end?>
      <li><uicontrol id="initial_state">Initial State</uicontrol> - Track Changes is turned on and
        off separately for each document you open. You may have some opened documents for which
        track changes is turned on and others for which it is turned off. This setting specifies
        whether <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> is turned on when you open a document. The
        options are:<ul>
          <li><uicontrol>Stored in document</uicontrol> - The current state of track changed is
            stored in the document itself, meaning that track changes on or off depending on the
            state the last time the document was saved. This is the recommended setting when
            multiple writers work on the same set of documents as it will make it obvious to other
            writers that changes have been made in the document. </li>
          <li><uicontrol>Always On</uicontrol> - The <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> feature is
            always on when you open a document. You can turn it off for an open document, but it
            will be turned on for the next document you open. </li>
          <li><uicontrol>Always Off</uicontrol> - The <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> feature
            is always off when you open a document. You can turn it on for an open document, but it
            will be turned off for the next document you open. </li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><uicontrol>Display changed lines marker</uicontrol> - A changed line maker is a vertical
        line on the left side of the editor window indicating where changes have been made in the
        document. It is displayed only for documents for which track changes is turned on. To hide
        the changed lines marker, deselect this option.</li>
      <li><uicontrol>Inserted content color</uicontrol> - Sets the color that is used for marking
        inserted content. This includes the font foreground and background, and the underline that
        decorates all inserted text. The options are:<ul>
          <li><uicontrol>Auto</uicontrol> - A different color is assigned to each writer's changes.
            This is the default option.</li>
          <li><uicontrol>Custom</uicontrol> - Uses the specified color for all changes, regardless
            of the writer's name.</li>
          <li><uicontrol><?oxy_comment_start author="Mark" timestamp="20140901T170806-0400" comment="This should be changed in the UI. It is not clear what &quot;same color&quot; refers to. Same as what? &quot;Don&apos;t change text foreground color&quot; might be a better name for this option."?>Use
              same color for text foreground<?oxy_comment_end?></uicontrol> - The text foreground is
            displayed in the same color as surrounding text, not the inserted content color.</li>
          <li><uicontrol><?oxy_comment_start author="Mark" timestamp="20140901T171635-0400" comment="Same comment as above."?>Use
              same color for background<?oxy_comment_end?></uicontrol> - The text background is
            displayed in the same color as surrounding text, not the inserted content color.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><uicontrol>Deleted content color</uicontrol> - Sets the color that is used for marking
        deleted content. The options are the same as for the <uicontrol>Inserted content
          color</uicontrol>.</li>
      <li><uicontrol>Comments color (applies for all authors)</uicontrol> - Sets the background
        color of the text that is commented on. The options are:<ul
          id="ul_ab333fe6-748e-4ddd-9efc-8ad89410160e">
          <li><uicontrol>Auto</uicontrol> - A different color is assigned to each writer's changes.
            This is the default option.</li>
          <li><uicontrol>Custom</uicontrol> - Uses the specified color for all changes, regardless
            of the writer's name. Use the slider to control the transparency level.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
