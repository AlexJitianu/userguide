    is preserved during an upgrade<?oxy_comment_end?></title>
  <body>
    <p>When you install a new version of <ph keyref="product"/>, some data is preserved and some is
      overwritten. If there is a previous version of <ph keyref="product"/> already installed on
      your computer, it can coexist with the new one, which means you don't have to uninstall it. </p>
    <p>If you install over a previously installed version:</p>
    <ul id="ul_qmm_1jx_x4">
      <li>All the files from its install directory will be removed, including any modification in
        frameworks files, <xref
          href="../topics/predefined-document-types.dita#predefined-document-types" format="dita"
          >predefined document type</xref>, XSLT stylesheets, XML catalogs, and templates. </li>
      <?oxy_comment_start author="Mark" timestamp="20140730T173207-0400" comment="Are the user preferences imported or are they shared? That is, if I have two versions, do they share one set of preferences, so that if one updates the preferences, the other recieves them as well?"?>
      <li>All global user preferences are preserved and will be imported into the new version.
        <?oxy_comment_end?></li>
      <li>All project preferences will be preserved in their project files. </li>
      <li>Any custom frameworks that were stored outside the installation directory (as configured
        in <xref keyref="options_document-type-associations"><menucascade>
            <uicontrol>Document type associations</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>Locations</uicontrol>
