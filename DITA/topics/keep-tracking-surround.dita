  <title>Keep Tracking of Surrounded Content</title>
  <body>
    <p>When <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> is enabled and you surround content in a new XML
      element, the following cases are possible:<ul>
        <li>making a surround in a <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> change - nothing happens</li>
        <li>making a surround in an <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change:<ul>
            <li>if the original insertion was made by another user, the change is split in two and
              the surround operation appears marked as being performed by the current author</li>
            <li>if the original <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change was made by the same user, the
              existing change is just expanded to contain the surrounded content</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>making a surround in regular content -  the operation is marked as a surround
          change.</li>
      </ul></p>
