  <title>Inline Linking in DITA</title>
  <body>
    <p>You can create inline links in the content of a DITA topic using the <codeph>xref</codeph>
      element. To insert a link in <ph keyref="product"/>
      <xref keyref="mode.author">Author mode</xref>, click the link button on the DITA Toolbar

      <title>Linking using keys</title>
      <p>To make links easier to manage, you may choose to use <xref keyref="dita.background.keys"
          >keys</xref> for linking, rather than creating direct links to topics. By using keys, you
        avoid creating a direct dependency between topics, which can make it easier to reuse topics
        in different publications. It can also be helpful in verifying the completeness of a
        publication, by ensuring that a publication map provides a key definition for every key
        reference used in the content. </p>
      <p>Links based on keys require two pieces. The first piece is a key definition, which assigns
        a key to a topic so that other topics can link to it. The second piece is a key reference,
        which is created in an <codeph>xref</codeph> element and specifies the key to link to.  Thus
        the key reference points to a key definition, and the key definition points to a topics. </p>
      <p>Key definitions are created in maps, as an element on the <codeph>topicref</codeph> element
        that points to a topic. Thus a key reference points to a key definition on a
          <codeph>topicref</codeph> that points to a topic. </p>
      <p>This allows you to assign a particular key to one topic in one map and to another topic in
        another map. When a topic that links to that key is used in each of these maps, the links
        work correctly in both maps.</p>
      <p>Note that you can define more than one key on the same topic reference. Topics can link to
        any of they keys. This can allow you to have topics that link to different keys link to the
        same topic in one map and to different topics in another map.</p>
