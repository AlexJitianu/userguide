  <title>How To Share a Tomcat Instance Between <ph keyref="webapp"/> And Another
    Application</title>
  <body>
    <p>Due to a class loader issue, the oXygen XML built-in protocol handlers cannot be used in a
      scenario where the WebApp shares the same Apache Tomcat instance with another application. To
      disable the protocol handlers initialization, set the <xref
        href="customizing-options.dita#customizing-options/webapp_config_file"
          ><codeph>com.oxygenxml.loadBuiltinProtocolHandlers</codeph> option</xref> to
        <codeph>false</codeph>.</p>
    <p>Also, the following issues need to be considered:<ul id="ul_xbd_cmt_1r">
        <li>oXygen reads and sets system properties, and while we try to namespace oXygen-specific
          ones, there is no guarantee that there will not be any clashes with those set by other
          applications.</li>
        <li>you have to adapt the JVM's memory configuration to the scenario where there will be
          more applications competing for the same pool of memory.</li>
        <li><ph keyref="webapp"/> currently does not restart (or <term>reload</term> in Apache
          Tomcat terminology) correctly unless the Apache Tomcat server is also restarted.</li>
      </ul></p>
