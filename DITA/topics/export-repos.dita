    <p>This is the process of taking a resource from the repository and saving it locally in a clean
      form, with no version control information. This is very useful when you need a clean build for
      an installation kit.</p>
    <p>The export dialog is very similar to the check out dialog:</p>
    <fig>
      <title>Export from Repository</title>
      <image href="../img/sa_svn_export_dialog.png"/>
    </fig>
    <p>You can choose the target directory from the file system by pressing the
        <uicontrol>Browse</uicontrol> button. If you need to export a specific revision, you can
      select the <uicontrol>Revision</uicontrol> radio button and then click on the
        <uicontrol>History</uicontrol> button and choose a revision from the new dialog. Or you
      could simply type the revision number in the corresponding text field.</p>
    <p>
      <note>The content of the selected directory from the repository and not the directory itself
        will be exported to the file system.</note>
      <note type="warning">The destination directory should be empty. If files exist, they will be
        overwritten by exported files with matching names.  </note>
