    <p><ph keyref="product"/> lets you configure how character encodings are recognized when opening
      files and which encodings are used when saving files. To configure encoding options, <ph
        conkeyref="reusable.menus/open-the-preferences-page"/> and go to <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Encoding</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>. The following encoding options are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li product="author developer editor svnClient"><uicontrol>Fallback character
          encoding</uicontrol> - Default character encoding of non-XML documents if their character
        encoding cannot be determined from other sources (like, for example, specified in the
        document itself, or determined by the file type).<note>For certain document types, the
          following encoding detection rules are used:<ul>
            <li>For XML, DTD and CSS documents, <ph keyref="product"/> tries to collect the
              character encoding from the document. If no such encoding is found, then
                <term>UTF-8</term> is used.</li>
            <li>For JavaScript, JSON, SQL, XQuery, and RNC, the <term>UTF-8</term> encoding is
              used.</li>
          </ul></note>
      </li>
      <li product="editor author developer"><uicontrol>UTF-8 BOM handling</uicontrol> - This setting
        specifies how to handle the <term>Byte Order Mark</term> (BOM) when <ph keyref="product"/>
        saves a UTF-8 XML document: <ul>
          <li><uicontrol>Don't Write</uicontrol> - do not save the BOM bytes. Loaded BOM bytes are
            ignored.</li>
          <li><uicontrol>Write</uicontrol> - save the BOM bytes.</li>
          <li><uicontrol>Keep</uicontrol> - do not alter the BOM declaration of the currently open
            file. This is the default option.</li>
        </ul><note>The UTF-16 BOM is always preserved. UTF-32 documents have a
            <term>big-endian</term> byte order.</note></li>
      <li product="author developer editor svnClient"><uicontrol>Encoding errors
          handling</uicontrol> - This setting specifies how to handle characters that cannot be
        represented in the character encoding that is used when the document is opened. The
        available options are:<ul>
          <li><uicontrol>REPORT</uicontrol> - displays an error identifying the character that
            cannot be represented in the specified encoding. Unrecognized characters are rendered as
            an empty box. This is the default option.</li>
          <li><uicontrol>IGNORE</uicontrol> - the error is ignored and the character is not included
            in the document displayed in the editor.<note type="attention">If you edit and save the
              document, the characters that cannot be represented in the specified encoding are
              dropped.</note></li>
          <li><uicontrol>REPLACE</uicontrol> - the character is replaced with a standard replacement
            character. For example, if the encoding is UTF-8, the replacement character has the
            Unicode code <codeph>FFFD</codeph>, and if the encoding is ASCII, the replacement
            character code is 63.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
