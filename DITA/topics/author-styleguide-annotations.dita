  <title>Providing additional documentation for XML elements and attributes</title>
  <body>
    <p>The application gathers from the associated schemas (DTDs, XML Schema, RelaxNG) and presents
      documentation for each element or attribute. For example if you open the <uicontrol>Content
        Completion Window</uicontrol> for a recognized XML vocabulary you will see for each element
      documentation provided by the schema which is associated with it. Similar information is shown
      when you hover the mouse pointer over tag names presented in the <uicontrol>Elements
        view</uicontrol>. If you hover over attributes in the <uicontrol>Attributes view</uicontrol>
      you will also get information about what each attribute does gathered from the same schema
      information.</p>
    <p>If you have a document type configuration set up for your XML vocabulary, there is a special
      XML configuration file which can be added that provides additional documentation information
      or links to specification web pages for certain elements and attributes. The following steps
      should be taken in order to provide this additional information:<ol id="ol_js3_4k5_kq">
        <li>Create a new folder in your document type's configuration directory like for example:
            <filepath>OXYGEN_INSTALL_DIR/frameworks/dita/styleguide</filepath>.</li>
        <li>From the application <uicontrol>Document Type Association</uicontrol> preferences page
          edit the document type configuration for your XML vocabulary and in the
            <uicontrol>Classpath</uicontrol> tab add a link to the newly created folder.</li>
        <li>Use the <uicontrol>New</uicontrol> dialog wizard to create a file using the new file
          template <filepath>Oxygen content completion styleguide</filepath>.</li>
        <li>Make the proper changes to your custom mapping file. As examples you can look at how the
          DITA mapping file is configured:
            <filepath>OXYGEN_INSTALL_DIR/frameworks/dita/styleguide/contentCompletionElementsMap.xml</filepath>.
          The associated XML Schema contains additional details about how each element and attribute
          should be used in the mapping file.</li>
        <li>Save the file using the fixed name <filepath>contentCompletionElementsMap.xml</filepath>
          in the newly created folder.</li>
        <li>Reopen the application and open an XML document, in the <uicontrol>Content Completion
            Window</uicontrol> you should see the additional annotations for each element.</li>
      </ol></p>
