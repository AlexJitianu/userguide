    <p>The core of oXygen XML Author can be deployed on a server, allowing a variety of
      HTML5-enabled client devices to edit and review XML content. <note>Despite the efforts spent
        to ensure that the frameworks, options, and plugins behave similarly in both WebApp and
        standalone version of oXygen XML Author, there might be some differences imposed by specific
        platform limitations.</note></p>

          specially tuned frameworks for <ph
            conref="editingActions.dita#editingActions/webapp_supported_frameworks"/>. Any other
