  <title>Licensing the <ph keyref="webapp"/></title>

    <p>oXygen WebApp uses a floating license model, where the license key is stored on a server and
      individual users consume license seats from a common pool. </p>
    <section>
      <title>How it works</title>
      <p>The license key contains the maximum number of users that can simultaneously access the
        WebApp at any given moment. After a period of inactivity, the license allocated to that user
        becomes available. </p>
      <p>While no personal information is sent to the server, a cookie that identifies the user is
        auto-generated. Note that the use of two different browsers (for example, Firefox and
        Chrome) by a single user, will consume two floating licenses. However, using two or more
        windows or tabs of the same browser, consumes a single floating license.</p>
