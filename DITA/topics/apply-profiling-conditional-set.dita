  <title>Apply Profiling Condition Sets</title>
  <body>
    <p>All defined Profiling Condition Sets are available as shortcuts in the Profiling /
      Conditional Text menu. Select a menu entry to apply the condition set. The filtered content is
      grayed-out in the <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode, <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> view, and
        <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> view. An element is filtered-out when one of its
      attributes is part of the condition set and its value does not match any of the value covered
      by the condition set. As an example, let us suppose that you have the following document:</p>
    <fig>
      <image href="../img/apply_condition_set_before.png"/>
    </fig>
    <p>If you apply the following condition set it means that you want to filter-out the content
      written for non-expert audience and having the <i>Other</i> attribute value different than
        <i>prop1</i>.</p>
    <fig>
      <image href="../img/expert_user_condition_set.png"/>
    </fig>
    <p>And this is how the document looks like after you apply the <i>Expert user</i> condition
      set:</p>
    <fig>
      <image href="../img/apply_codition_set_after.png"/>
    </fig>
