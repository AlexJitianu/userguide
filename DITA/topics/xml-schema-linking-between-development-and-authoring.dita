  <title>Linking Between Development and Authoring</title>
  <body>
    <p>The <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode is available on the XML Schema editor allowing you to
      edit visually the schema annotations. It presents a polished and compact view of the XML
      Schema, with support for links on imported/included schemas. Embedded Schematron is supported
      only in Relax NG schemas with XML syntax.</p>
