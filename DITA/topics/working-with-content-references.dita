        <p>The <codeph>conref</codeph> DITA feature (short for <i>content reference</i>) lets you
      include a piece of source content as reference in other contexts. When you need to update that
      content, you do it in only one place. Typical uses of content references are for product
      names, warnings, definitions or process steps.</p>
        <p>You can use either or both of the following strategies for managing content
            references:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Reusable components</i> - With this strategy, you create a new file for each
                piece of content that you want to reuse.</li>
            <li><i>Arbitrary content references</i> - You may prefer to keep many pieces of reusable
        content in one file. For example, you might want one file to consist of a list of product
        names, with each product name in a <codeph>phrase</codeph> (<codeph>&lt;ph&gt;</codeph>
        element) within the file. Then, wherever you need to display a product name, you can insert
        a content reference that points to the appropriate <codeph>&lt;ph&gt;</codeph> element in
        this file.<note>A reference displays tracked changes and also comments of the source
          fragment. To edit these comments or accept/reject the changes, right click them and select
            <uicontrol>Edit Reference</uicontrol>.</note><p>This strategy requires more setup than
          reusable components, but makes easier centrally managing the reused content.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><ph keyref="product"/> creates a reference to
            the external content by adding a <codeph>conref</codeph> attribute to an element in the
            local document. The <codeph>conref</codeph> attribute defines a link to the referenced
            content, made up of a path to the file and the topic ID within the file. The path may
            also reference a specific element ID within the topic. Referenced content is not
            physically copied to the referencing file, but <ph
                keyref="product"/> displays it as if it
            is there in the referencing file. You can also choose to view local content instead of
            referenced content, to edit the attributes or contents of the referencing element.</p>
