        <p>The DITA <codeph>conref</codeph> feature (short for <i>content reference</i>) lets you
      insert a piece of source content by referencing it from its source. When you need to update
      that content, you only need to do it in one place.</p>
        <p>There are several strategies for managing content references:</p>
        <ul>
      <li><i>Reusable components</i> - With this strategy, you create a new file for each piece of
        content that you want to reuse.</li>
      <li><i>Single-source content references</i> - You may prefer to keep many pieces of reusable
        content in one file.

Then, wherever you need to display a product name, you can insert a content reference that points to the appropriate &lt;ph&gt; element in this file.&quot; I think this example would be better for key references."?>For
        example, you might want to create a single file that contains all the actions that are
        available in various menus or toolbars for your software application. Then, wherever you
        need to describe or display an action in your documentation, you can reuse content from that
        single file by inserting content references.<?oxy_comment_end?> This strategy requires more
        setup than reusable components, but might make it easier to centrally managing the reused
        content.</li>
      <li><i>Arbitrary content references</i> - Although it is not recommended, you can create
        content references amongst topics without storing the reusable content in components or a
        single file. This strategy might make it difficult to manage content that is reused and to
        maintain continuity and accuracy, since you may not have any indication that content you are
        editing is reused elsewhere.    </li>
    </ul>
        <p><ph keyref="product"/> creates a reference to the external content by adding a
        <codeph>conref</codeph> attribute to an element in the local document. The
        <codeph>conref</codeph> attribute defines a link to the referenced content, made up of a
      path to the file and the topic ID within the file. The path may also reference a specific
      element ID within the topic. Referenced content is not physically copied to the referencing
      file. However, by default <ph keyref="product"/> displays it in <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol>
      mode as if it is there in the referencing file. If you do not want referenced content
      displayed, <ph conkeyref="reusable_menus/open-the-preferences-page"/>, go to <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Editor</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Edit modes</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>, and disable the <uicontrol>Display referenced content</uicontrol> option.</p>
    <note>A reference also displays tracked changes and comments that are included in the source
      fragment. To edit these comments (or accept/reject changes) right-click the comment or tracked
      change and select <uicontrol>Edit
      Reference</uicontrol><?oxy_comment_start author="steven_higgs" timestamp="20150731T112151+0300" comment="Add related links to: Working with Keys, Working with Reusable Components, and Working with the Conref Push Mechanism."?>.<?oxy_comment_end?></note>
