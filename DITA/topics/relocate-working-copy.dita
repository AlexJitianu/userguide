    <p>Sometimes the base URL of the repository is changed after a working copy is checked out from
      that URL. For example, if the repository itself is moved to a different server. In such cases,
      you do not have to check out a working copy from the new repository location. It is easier to
      change the base URL of the root folder of the working copy to the new URL of the repository. </p>
    <p>This <uicontrol>Relocate</uicontrol>action is available in the <uicontrol>Tools</uicontrol>
      menu when selecting the root item of the working copy.</p>
