    <p>Sometimes the base URL of the repository is changed after a working copy is checked out from
      that URL, for example the repository itself is relocated to a different server. In such cases
      you do not have to check out again a working copy from the new repository location. It is
      easier to change the base URL of the root folder of the working copy to the new URL of the
      repository. This action is called <uicontrol>Relocate</uicontrol> and is available on the
        <uicontrol>Tools</uicontrol> menu when the selected item in <xref href="working-copy-view.dita#working-copy-view" format="dita">the <uicontrol>Working
          Copy</uicontrol> view</xref> is a versioned folder.</p>
    <p>If the selected item is not the root folder of the working copy then the effect is the same
      as for <xref href="switch-repository-location.dita">the <uicontrol>Switch</uicontrol>
        action</xref> applied on the same selected item.</p>
