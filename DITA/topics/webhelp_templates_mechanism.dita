  <title>WebHelp Responsive Template Mechanism</title>
    <body>
    <p>The WebHelp Responsive template is the base of the WH Responsive system being responsible for
      defining its output. It consists of a set of HTML template pages and other additional
      resources (such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files). Each HTML template file contains one or
      more template components (such as title, table of contents, search input) whose placement
      inside the template will define the final output layout.</p>
    <p>This allows you to create multiple output layouts only by creating templates that define the
      location where the various components will be displayed.</p>
    <p>The next topics will describe which are the template pages, template components, and the
      template directory structure.</p>
