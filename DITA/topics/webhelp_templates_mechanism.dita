    <p>The WebHelp Responsive template mechanism is the base of the system and it is responsible for
      defining its output. It consists of a set of HTML template pages and other additional
      resources (such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files). Each HTML template file contains one or
      more template components (such as title, table of contents, search input, etc.) whose
      placement inside the template will define the final layout of the output.</p>
    <p>This mechanism allows you to create multiple layouts simply by creating templates that define
      the location of where the various components will be displayed.</p>
    <p>The section provides information about the four types of template pages, the various template
      components, and the required template directory structure.</p>
