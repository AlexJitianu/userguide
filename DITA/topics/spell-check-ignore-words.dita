  <body>
    <p>The content of some XML elements like <codeph>programlisting</codeph>,
        <codeph>codeblock</codeph> or <codeph>screen</codeph> should always be skipped by the spell
      checking process. The skipping can be done manually word by word by the user using the
        <uicontrol>Ignore</uicontrol> button of <xref
        href="using-check-spelling.dita#using-check-spelling" format="dita">the
          <uicontrol>Spelling</uicontrol> dialog</xref> or, more conveniently, automatically by
      maintaining a set of known element names that should never be checked. You maintain

Can this dialog acutally recognize namespaces or just literal prefixes? Recognizing namespaces would be very useful, as you might want one element name checked in one schema and not in another."?>this

    <p>Only a small subset of XPath expressions is supported, that is only the '/' and '//'
      separators and the '*' wildcard. Two examples of supported expressions are
        <codeph>/a/*/b</codeph> and <codeph>//c/d/*</codeph>.</p>
