    <p>Besides built-in support for various URL protocols like HTTP(s) or FTP(s) the application has
      special support for a <filepath>convert</filepath> protocol which can be used to chain
      predefined processors in order to dynamically import content from various sources.</p>
    <p>A GitHub Project which contains various dynamic conversion samples for producing DITA content
      from various sources can be found here: <xref href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/dita-glass"
