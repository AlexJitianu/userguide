  <title>Chunking DITA topics</title>
  <body>
    <p>By default, when a <xref keyref="dita.pathfinder.documents">DITA map</xref> is published to
      an online format, each topic will become a separate page in the output. In some cases, you may
      wish to combine multiple source topics into one output page. (For instance, you may wish to
      combine several types of information into a single page, or you may have chosen to create many
      small DITA topics for reuse purposes, but feel they are too small to be useful to a reader by
      themselves.)</p>
    <p>To chunk DITA topics, you set the chunking attribute on the <codeph>topicref</codeph> that
      contains the sub-topics in a DITA map. There are a number of different values you can set on
      the chunking attribute. See the DITA documentation for full details. To achieve the effect you
      want in your topics and in your table of contents, you may also need to set the
        <codeph>toc</codeph> and <codeph>collection-type</codeph> attributes on the sub-topics or
      container topic to suitable values. See the DITA documentation for details. </p>
    <p>You can set the <codeph>collection-type</codeph> attribute on your topics using the
        <uicontrol>Edit Properties...</uicontrol> action in the <wintitle>DITA Maps
        Manager</wintitle>. To set the <codeph>toc</codeph> and <codeph>chunk</codeph> attributes,
      you must open the map file in the editor and add or edit the attributes directly. (Double
      click on the Map icon <image href="../img/TreeMode16.png" id="image_qsq_cbm_1q"/> in the
        <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle> to open the map in the editor.)</p>
