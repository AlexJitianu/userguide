  <title>Chunking DITA topics</title>
  <body>
    <p>By default, when a DITA map is published to an online format, each topic will become a
      separate page in the output. In some cases, you may wish to combine multiple source topics
      into one output page. (For instance, you may wish to combine several types of information into
      a single page, or you may have chosen to create many small DITA topics for reuse purposes, but
      feel they are too small to be useful to a reader by themselves. </p>
