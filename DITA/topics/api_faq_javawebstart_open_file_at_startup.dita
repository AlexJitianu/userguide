      <title>Question</title>
      <p>How can we dynamically open a file in an <ph
          keyref="product"/> distributed via JWS?</p>
    </section>

      <title>Answer</title>
      <p>The JWS packager ANT build file which comes with <ph keyref="product"/> signs by default the JNLP file
        (this means that a copy of it is included in the main JAR library) in this
        step:<codeblock outputclass="language-xml"> 
&lt;copy file="${outputDir}/${packageName}/${productName}.jnlp" tofile="${home}/JNLP-INF/APPLICATION.JNLP"/&gt;
</codeblock>Signing
        the JNLP file indeed means that it is impossible to automatically generate a JNLP file
        containing some dynamic arguments.</p>
      <p>But the JNLP does not need to be signed. Indeed the user probably receives this information
        when launching the application but at least in this way you should be able to dynamically
        generate a JNLP file via a PHP script based on the URL which was clicked by the user.</p>
      <p>The generated JNLP would then take as argument the URL which needs to be opened when <ph keyref="product"/>
        starts.</p>
      <p>Maybe a different approach (more complicated though) would be to have the JNLP file signed
        and always refer as a URL argument a location like this:
        <codeblock>http://path/to/server/redirectEditedURL.php</codeblock>When the URL gets clicked
        on the client side you would also call a PHP script on the server side which would update
        the redirect location for <codeph>redirectEditedURL.php</codeph> to point to the clicked XML
        resource. Then the opened <ph keyref="product"/> would try to connect to the redirect PHP and be redirected
        to open the XML.</p>
