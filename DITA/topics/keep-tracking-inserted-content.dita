    <p>When <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> is disabled and you insert content, the following
      cases are possible:<ul>
        <li>making an insertion in a <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> change - the change is split in
          two and the content is inserted without being marked as change;</li>
        <li>making an insertion in a <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> change - the change is split in
          two and the content is inserted without being marked as change;</li>
        <li>making an insertion in an <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change, the change is split in
          two and the content is inserted without being marked as change;</li>
        <li>making an insertion in regular content - regular insertion. </li>
      </ul>

    <p>When <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> is enabled and you insert content, the following
      cases are possible:<ul>
        <li>making an insertion in a <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> change - the change is split in
          two and the current inserted content appears marked as an INSERT;</li>
        <li>making an insertion in an <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change:<ul>
            <li> if the original insertion was made by another user, the change is split in two and
              the current inserted content appears marked as an INSERT by the current author;</li>
            <li> if the original <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change was made by the same user, the
              change is just expanded to contain the inserted content. The creation time-stamp of
              the previous insert is preserved;</li>
            <li> if we insert in regular content, the current inserted content appears marked as an
                <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change.</li>
          </ul></li>
