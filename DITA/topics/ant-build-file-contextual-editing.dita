  <title>Editing Ant Build Files in the Master Files Context</title>
  <body>
    <p>Smaller interrelated modules that define a complex ant build file cannot be correctly edited
      or validated individually, due to their interdependency with other modules. For example, a
      template defined in a main build file is not visible when you edit an included or imported
      module. <ph keyref="product"/> provides the support for defining the main module (or modules),
      allowing you to edit any of the imported/included files in the context of the larger Ant build
      structure.</p>
    <p>You cat set a main Ant build file <ph>either using the <xref
          href="defining_master_files.dita#defining_master_files">master files support from the
            <uicontrol>Project</uicontrol> view</xref>, or</ph> using a validation scenario.</p>
    <p>To set a main file using a validation scenario, add validation units that point to the main
      modules. <ph keyref="product"/> warns you if the current module is not part of the
      dependencies graph computed for the main build file. In this case, it considers the current
      module as the main build file.</p>
    <p>The advantages of editing in the context of main file include: <ul>
      <li>correct validation of a module in the context of a larger build structure;</li>
      <li><uicontrol>Content Completion Assistant</uicontrol> displays all components valid in the
        current context;</li>
      <li>the <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> displays the components collected from the entire build
          file structure.</li>
    </ul></p>
