    <p>Recording changes has limitations and there is no guarantee that rejecting all changes will
      return the document to exactly the same state in which it originally was. Some of the
      limitations are listed below:<ol id="ol_jv3_shv_z3">
        <li>Recorded changes are not hierarchical, a change cannot contain other changes inside. For
          example, if you delete an insertion made by another user, then reject the deletion, the
          information about the author who made the previous insertion is not preserved.</li>
        <li>Surrounding a selection with a certain element is not (yet) recorded as a change.</li>
      </ol></p>
