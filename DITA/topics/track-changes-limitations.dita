    <p>Recording changes has limitations and there is no guarantee that rejecting all changes will
      return the document to exactly the same state in which it originally was. Recorded changes are
      not hierarchical, a change cannot contain other changes inside. For example, if you delete an
      insertion made by another user, then reject the deletion, the information about the author who
      made the previous insertion is not preserved.</p>
