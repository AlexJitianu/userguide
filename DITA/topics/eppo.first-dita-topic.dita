    <p>To create your first DITA topic, choose <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>File</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>New...</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>. The <xref href="../tasks/new-dialog-sa.dita#new-dialog-sa"><uicontrol>New

    <p>Go to <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Framework templates</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>DITA</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>topics</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> and select the topic type that you want to create. </p>
    <note>Note that if you organization has created any kind of DITA customizations, the appropriate
      template files may be in another location, and different topic types may be provided for your
      use. Check with the person who manages your DITA system to see if you should be using
      templates from a different directory.</note>
    <p>Your DITA topic is an XML document. As such, all <xref keyref="get-started.xml-document">the
        editing features that <ph keyref="product"/> provides for editing XML documents</xref> apply
      to DITA topics. However, <ph keyref="product"/> also provides extensive additional support for
      editing DITA topics and their associated maps and other files, and for creating DITA
      outputs.</p>

      <title>Understanding DITA topics</title>
      <p>It is important to understand the role that a DITA topic plays in a DITA system. A DITA
        topic is not associated with a single document. It is a separate entity that can potentially
        be included in many different documents, help systems, or websites. When you write a DITA
        topic, therefore, you are not writing a book or a help systems or a website, you are writing
        an individual topic. This affects how you approach the writing task and how <ph
          keyref="product"/> works to support you as you write.</p>
      <p>Of course, most of your topics are actually connected more or less strongly to other
        topics, and those connections can affect how you write and how you handle things like links
        and references as you write. <ph keyref="product"/> can help you manage those relationships.
        Depending on how tightly or loosely your topics are connected you may use <ph
          keyref="product"/>'s tools (and features of DITA itself) in different ways.</p>

      <title>The role of maps</title>
      <p>The basic way that DITA expresses the relationship between topics is through a DITA map.
        Other relationships between topics, such as cross references, generally need to be between
        topics in the same map, as DITA uses maps to determine which topics will be part of any
        output set that you create. While customized DITA solutions can use other mechanisms,
        generally DITA does not provide a way to output individual topics. Output is created from a
        map and includes the topics referenced by the map. </p>
      <p>A publication is not always represented by a single map. For instance, if you are writing a
        book, you might use a map to create each chapter, and then collect the chapters together in
        another map to create the book. If you are writing help topics, you might use a map to
        combine several DITA topics to create a single help topic, and then create another map to
        organize your help topics into a help systems. In this way, you can potentially reuse a map
        that represents a chapter or a help topic in more than one book or help system.</p>
