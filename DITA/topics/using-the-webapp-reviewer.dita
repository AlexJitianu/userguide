  <title>Using the <ph keyref="webapp"/></title>
  <body>
    <p><ph keyref="webapp"/> web editing platform leverages the advanced oXygen XML authoring
      technology to bring XML editing and reviewing to your mobile devices, as well as your desktop
      systems. The innovative mobile-first design of the user interface allows you to interact with
      your XML content like never before.</p>
    <p><ph keyref="webapp"/> is an independent product, designed to complement the oXygen XML suite.
      You can give it a try by <xref href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/oxygen_webapp_add_on.html"
        format="html" scope="external">installing it as an add-on</xref>. However, to be able to use
      it in a production environment, it needs <xref href="webapp_deployment.dita#webapp_deployment"
        >server deployment</xref> and a dedicated <ph keyref="webapp"/> license.</p>
