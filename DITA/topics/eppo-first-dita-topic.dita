        DITA Topics<?oxy_comment_end?></title>
      <p>It is important to understand the role that a DITA topic plays in a DITA project. A DITA
        topic is not associated with a single published document. It is a separate entity that can
        potentially be included in many different books, help systems, or websites. Therefore, when
        you write a DITA topic you are not writing a book, a help system, or a website. You are
        writing an individual piece of content. This affects how you approach the writing task and
        how <ph keyref="product"/> works to support you as you write.</p>
      <p>Most of your topics are actually related to other topics, and those relationships can
        affect how you write and handle things such as links and content reuse. <ph keyref="product"
        /> helps you manage those relationships. Depending on how your topics are related, you can
        use the tools provided in <ph keyref="product"/>, along with the features of DITA, in a
        variety of different ways.</p>

        Role of Maps<?oxy_comment_end?></title>
      <p>The basic method that DITA uses to express the relationship between topics is through a
        DITA map. Other relationships between topics, such as cross references, generally need to be
        made between topics in the same map. DITA uses maps to determine which topics are part of
        any output that you create. While customized DITA solutions can use other mechanisms,
        generally DITA is not used as a way to publish individual topics. Output is created from a
        map and includes all the topics referenced by the map. </p>
      <p>A publication is not always represented by a single map. For instance, if you are writing a
        book, you might use a map to create each chapter and then organize the chapters in another
        map to create the book. If you are writing help topics, you might use a map to combine
        several DITA topics to create a single help topic and then create another map to organize
        your help topics in a help system. This allows you to reuse the content of a map in multiple
        projects.</p>

        a Map<?oxy_comment_end?></title><p>To add topics to a map, you must first create the map. A
        map is an XML document, similar to a topic. To create a map, select <ph

        you want to open your map in the editor or in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>.
        Usually, opening it in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> is the best choice, but
        you can also open the map in the editor from the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>.
        The <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> presents a view of the DITA map that is similar
        to a table of contents.</p><image href="../img/sa_dita_maps_manager_new.png"

        Topics to a Map<?oxy_comment_end?></title>
      <p>To add a topic to a map, add a topic reference to the map using a <codeph>topicref</codeph>
        element. The easiest way to do this is to open the topic in the editor, then right-click the
        DITA map in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> view and choose
          <uicontrol>Reference to the currently edited file</uicontrol> from the <uicontrol>Append
          child</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Insert After</uicontrol> submenus. This opens the <xref
          href="dita-insert-topic-ref.dita#dita-insert-topic-ref"><uicontrol>Insert
            Reference</uicontrol> dialog box</xref> with all of the required fields already filled
        in for you. You can fill in additional information in the various tabs in this dialog box or
        add it to the map later. When you select <uicontrol>Insert and close</uicontrol>, a
        reference to your topic is added to the map.</p>
      <fig product="editor author" id="fig_o55_zvc_vq">
        <title>Insert Reference Dialog Box</title>
        <image href="../img/sa_insert_ref_target_tab.png" id="image_jw5_zvc_vq"/>
      </fig>
      <fig product="editorEclipse authorEclipse" id="fig_z24_1wc_vq">
        <title>Insert Reference Dialog Box</title>
        <image href="../img/ec_insert_ref_target_tab.png" id="image_eg4_1wc_vq"/>
      </fig>
      <p>If you want to see what the resulting map looks like in XML, save your map and then
        double-click the DITA map in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> view. The XML
        version of the map opens in the editor. </p>
      <p>As you add topics to your map, you may want to make a topic the child or sibling of another
        topic. This is usually done at the map level. To create a child topic reference, right-click
        the parent topic in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> view and choose
          <uicontrol>Append child</uicontrol>. To create a sibling topic reference, right-click a
        topic in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> view and choose <uicontrol>Insert
          After</uicontrol>. From either of these submenus you can then choose one of the following
        options:</p>
      <ul id="ul_vc4_rg4_pp">
        <li>
          <p><uicontrol>New</uicontrol> - Opens the <xref
              href="../tasks/create-topic-in-map.dita#create-topic-in-map"
                ><uicontrol>New</uicontrol> file wizard</xref> for creating a new topic. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><uicontrol>Reference</uicontrol> - Opens the <xref
              href="dita-insert-topic-ref.dita#dita-insert-topic-ref"><uicontrol>Insert
                Reference</uicontrol> dialog box</xref> that allows you to create a reference to an
            existing topic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><uicontrol>Reference to the currently edited file</uicontrol> - Opens the <xref
              href="dita-insert-topic-ref.dita#dita-insert-topic-ref"><uicontrol>Insert
                Reference</uicontrol> dialog box</xref> that helps you to easily create a reference
            to the file that is currently opened in the editor. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also change the order and nesting of topics in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps
          Manager</uicontrol> view by doing either of the following:<ul id="ul_ddp_brn_3q">
          <li>Select the topic to move while holding down the <uicontrol>Alt</uicontrol> key and use
            the arrow keys to move it around.</li>
          <li>Use the mouse to drag and drop the topic to the desired location.</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>The way your parent and child topics are organized in any particular output depends on both
        the configuration of those topics in the map and the rules of the output transformation that
        is applied to them. Do not assume that your topics must have the same organization for all
        output types. The map defines the organization of the topics, not the topics themselves. It
        is possible to create a variety of different maps, each with different organization and
        configuration options to produce a variety of different outputs. </p>

        Maps<?oxy_comment_end?></title>
      <p>If you have a large set of information, such as a long book or extensive help system, a
        single map can become long and difficult to manage. To make it easier to manage, you can
        break up the content into smaller maps. A smaller map might represent a chapter of a book, a
        section of a user manual, or a page on a website.</p>
      <p>To build a publication out of these smaller maps, you must add them to a map that
        represents the overall publication. To add a child map to the current map, right-click the
        parent DITA map and choose <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Append child</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Map reference</uicontrol>
        </menucascade>.</p>

        a Map<?oxy_comment_end?></title>
      <p>Just as it is with your individual topics, it is important to validate your maps. <ph
          keyref="product"/> provides a validation function for DITA maps that does more than simply
        validating that the XML is well formed. It also does the following: <ul id="ul_yp4_4bl_vp">
          <li>Validates all of the relationships defined in the maps.</li>
          <li>Validates all of the files that are included in the map.</li>
          <li>Validates all of the links that are expressed in the files.</li>
        </ul>Validating the map that describes your entire publication validates all the files that
        make up the publication and all of the relationships between them. To validate a map, click
        the <uicontrol><image href="../img/ValidateAndCheck16.png" id="image_wqb_3vv_sr"/>Validate

        Your Topics</title><?oxy_comment_end?><p>As noted previously, in DITA standards you usually
        do not publish output from an individual topic. Instead, you create published output by
        running a DITA transformation on a map. This collects all the topics that are referenced in
        the map, organizes them, and produces output in a particular format. By default, <ph
          keyref="product"/> uses the transformations provided by the <uicontrol>DITA Open
          Toolkit</uicontrol> for publishing to a variety of different output formats (such as PDF,
        WebHelp or EPUB). Your organization may have created various custom transformations or
        modified the built-in <uicontrol>DITA Open Toolkit</uicontrol> transformations. In either
        case, <ph keyref="product"/> manages them by using transformation scenarios. </p><p>To
        publish output for a map, select the transformation scenario you want to run and set any of
        the parameters it requires. To select a transformation, click the <uicontrol><image
            href="../img/TransformConfig16.png" id="image_l5w_lvv_sr"/>Configure Transformation
          Scenario(s)</uicontrol> button in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> view. This

    <p>Choose the transformation scenarios you want to apply and click <uicontrol>Apply
        associated</uicontrol>. Depending on the configuration of the transformation scenario, when
      the transformation is finished, your output may automatically be opened in the appropriate
      application. To change or view the configuration or storage options for a transformation
      scenario, select the transformation and click
