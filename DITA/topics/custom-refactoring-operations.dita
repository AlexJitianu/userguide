  <title>Custom Refactoring Operations</title>
  <body>
    <p>If none of the predefined operations will help you accomplish a particular refactoring task,
      you can create a custom operation that is specific to your needs. For example, if you want to
      convert an attribute to an element and insert the element as the first child of the parent
      element, a custom refactoring operation needs to be created.</p>
    <p>An XML Refactoring operation is defined with two resources:<ul id="ul_gwv_s4c_jr">
        <li>An <i>XQuery Update</i> script file that needs to be processed to refactor XML
          files.</li>
        <li>An <i>Operation Descriptor</i> file that contains information about the operation, such
          as the name, description, and parameters.</li>
      </ul><fig id="fig_dgt_f4c_jr">
        <title>Diagram of an XML Refactoring Operation</title>
        <image href="../img/refactoring_diagram1.png" id="image_ktw_k4c_jr"/>
      </fig></p>
    <p>All the defined operations are loaded by the XML Refactoring tool and presented in <xref
        href="xml-refactoring-tool.dita#xml-refactoring-tool/refactoring_operations_dlentry">the
          <uicontrol>Refactoring operations</uicontrol> dialog box</xref>. </p>
    <p>After the user chooses an operation and specifies its parameters, an XQuery update
      transformation is processed over the input file. This transformation is executed in a
        <term>safe mode</term>, which implies the following:<ul id="ul_mfj_dqc_jr">
        <li>The <codeph>DOCTYPE</codeph> will be preserved.</li>
        <li>The entities will be preserved.</li>
        <li>The attribute values will be kept in their original form without being normalized.</li>
        <li>The spaces between attributes are preserved. Basically, the spaces are lost by an XML
          serialization since they are not considered important.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>The result of this transformation overrides the initial input file.</p>

      <title>Creating a Custom Refactoring Operation</title>
      <p>To create a custom refactoring operation, follow these steps:<ol id="ol_swm_crc_jr">
          <li><xref href="custom-refactoring-xquery-script.dita">Create a custom XQuery script
              file</xref>.</li>
          <li><xref href="xml-refactoring-operation-descriptor.dita">Create a custom operation
              Descriptor file</xref>.</li>
          <li>Copy both files to the <i>refactoring</i> folder in the application installation
            directory (<filepath>[oXygen Installation Directory]/refactoring/</filepath>). <p>Once
              you restart the <uicontrol>XML Refactoring</uicontrol> tool, the custom operation
              appears in <xref
                href="xml-refactoring-tool.dita#xml-refactoring-tool/refactoring_operations_dlentry"
                >the <uicontrol>Refactoring operations</uicontrol> dialog box</xref>.</p></li>
        </ol></p>
