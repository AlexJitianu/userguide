      <title>First Rule for Good Documentation</title>
      <p>If you <i>really</i> want to produce great documentation, it needs to be edited. No matter
        how talented a writer happens to be, it is nearly impossible to avoid mistakes on the first
        attempt. … It is always good to have someone else review your documentation. When you read
        something you wrote yourself, you know what you <i>meant</i> to write, so it is really easy
        to just skip over typos or missing words.</p>

            <dt>Specific Grammar Rules in Regards to Specific Words</dt>
            <dd>The following rules ...<dl>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>"a" or "an"</dt>
                  <dd>REMEMBER, it's how the subsequent word SOUNDS, not how it is written. The rule
                    is that you use "a" before words that start with a consonant SOUND and "an"
                    before words that start with a vowel SOUND. The letters 'H' and 'U' usually
                    cause the most confusion. Examples: 'Unique' or 'URL'- You would use 'a' before
                    both words because they both begin with a 'you' SOUND. On the other hand,
                    'Unusual'- You would use 'an' before this word because it begins with an 'uh'
                    SOUND. 'Hour'- You would use 'an' because it begins with an 'a-wer' SOUND.
                    'HTTP'- Also use 'an' because it begins with an 'aye' SOUND. 'Honorable' begins
                    with an 'o' SOUND. Conversely, 'Historic' would need 'a' in front because it
                    begins with a "h" SOUND.</dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>"that" or "which"</dt>
                  <dd>To make a complex topic as simple as possible, follow this rule- use "that"
                    before a restrictive clause and "which" before nonrestrictive clauses. A
                    'restrictive clause' is just part of a sentence that you can't get rid of
                    because it specifically restricts some other part of the sentence. Here's an
                    example of a 'restrictive clause': Gems that sparkle often elicit forgiveness.
                    The words "that sparkle" restrict the kind of gems you're talking about. Without
                    them, the meaning of the sentence would change. A 'nonrestrictive clause' is
                    something that can be left off without changing the meaning of the sentence
                    (simply additional information). Here's an example of a 'nonrestrictive clause':
                    Diamonds, which are a type of gem, often elicit forgiveness. Alas, diamonds are
                    always a type of gem so leaving out the words "which are a type of gem" doesn't
                    change the meaning of the sentence. (Also note that the phrase is surrounded by
                    commas. Nonrestrictive clauses are usually surrounded by, or preceded by,
                    commas.)</dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>"to either" or "either to"</dt>
                  <dd>As a general rule, it is better to use "to either"... (example 1: We could go
                    "to either" Greece or Italy. Example 2: We could go "either to" Greece or
                    Italy.) When speaking, both phrases are acceptable. However, when writing,
                    example 1 ("to either") is more grammatically correct. The word "either" implies
                    a choice of two options and by placing the 'to' in front you are removing it
                    from the construction (either A or B). To use example 2 ("either to") you would
                    need to write: "We could go either to Greece or to Italy."</dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>"also"</dt>
                  <dd>Using the word 'also' can become very complicated in English grammar. USUALLY,
                    you will place 'also' before the verb or between what's called a modal verb
                    (i.e. can, should, must, might, could) and a normal verb (an example with one
                    normal verb: "He also speaks Romanian"; an example with a modal verb in front of
                    a normal verb: "He can also speak Romanian"). Notice that you do not place the
                    'also' after the verb 'speak'. That is grammatically incorrect. There are many
                    exceptions and sometimes you need to be aware that the placement of the word
                    'also' can change the meaning of a sentence (for example, "I will also go to
                    Greece" implies that I will go to Greece along with some other place, while "I
                    also will go to Greece" implies that I will go to Greece along with someone
                    else). One common exception: Typically, you will only place 'also' after a verb
                    if it's a simple sentence and the verb is a form of the verb 'to be' (for
                    example: "He is also Romanian"). Example from the website: "If you rename a
                    folder you can also update the references to the resources from that folder."
                    Originally, the 'also' was placed after 'update', which is incorrect. NOTE:
                    Sometimes it is more appropriate to avoid separating clauses, in which case it
                    is best to begin the sentence with 'Also,' (it should always be followed by a
                    comma in this situation). This places the 'also' completely outside the idea or
                    clause.</dd>

                <dlentry>
                  <dt>"etc."</dt>
                  <dd>Typically, only use 'etc.' inside brackets. Example: "(XML parser, XSLT
                    transformer, XQuery engine, etc.)"</dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                  <dt>"such as" or "like"</dt>
                  <dd>In most cases avoid using 'like' when you can use 'such as' instead. "Like"
                    suggests comparison (being similar to something) while "such as" suggests
                    inclusion (and example of). Example: "You can specify a set of transformation
                    scenarios to convert the XML documents to different formats, such as HTML and
                    PDF." You cannot use 'like' instead of such as because you are not comparing
                    formats to HTML or PDF. You are including them as examples. Here is an example
                    'like' is used properly: "Your documentation might include a sentence like the
                    one in the following example:". You can use the word 'like' in this case because
                    it is implying that the hypothetical "sentence" is similar to the one in the
                    example that follows.</dd>
