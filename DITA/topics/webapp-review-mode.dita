    <p>The <uicontrol>Review</uicontrol> mode provides an intuitive interface that enables you to
      view documents and document edits. To switch to this mode, tap or click the
        <uicontrol>Review</uicontrol> button. This panel presents comments, tracked changes, and
      document highlights. A <uicontrol>Preview</uicontrol> panel is also available at the bottom of
      the editing area. It displays the current comment or tracked change and the author who
      inserted it.</p>
