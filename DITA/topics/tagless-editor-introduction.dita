    <p>Once the structure of an XML document and the required restrictions on its elements and their
      attributes are defined with an XML schema, the editing of the document becomes easier in a
      WYSIWYG-style editor in which the XML markup is not visible.</p>
    <p>This type of tagless editor is available in <ph keyref="product"/> as the
        <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode. To enter this mode, click the
        <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> button at the bottom of the editing area. The
        <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode renders the content of the XML document visually, based
      on a CSS stylesheet associated with the document. Many of the actions and features available
      in <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> mode are also available in <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol>
      mode.</p>

        conkeyref="reusables-author-mode-customization/css.styles.intro"/>You can select a
        <term>main</term> CSS stylesheet that styles the whole document and then apply
        <term>alternate</term> styles, as layers, to specific parts of the document. In the
      subsequent figure, a DITA document has the <uicontrol>Century</uicontrol> style selected for
      the <term>main</term> CSS and the <term>alternate</term> styles <uicontrol>Full
        width</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Show table column specification</uicontrol>,
        <uicontrol>Hints</uicontrol>, and <uicontrol>Inline actions</uicontrol> are combined for
      additive styling to specific parts of the document.<fig id="css.styles.image">

      <title>Author Mode User Roles</title>
      <p>There are two main types of users of the <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode: <i>framework
          developers</i> and <i>content authors</i>. A <i>framework developer</i> is a technical
        person with advanced XML knowledge who defines the framework for authoring XML documents in
        the tagless editor. Once the framework is created or edited by the developer, it is
        distributed as a deliverable component ready to plug into the application for the content
        authors. A <i>content author</i> does not need to have advanced knowledge about XML tags,
        operations such as validation of XML documents, or applying an XPath expression to an XML
        document. The <i>content author</i> just uses the framework set-up by the developer in the
        application and starts editing the content of XML documents without editing the XML tags
        directly.</p>
      <p>The framework set-up by the developer is also called <i>document type association</i> and
        defines a type of XML document by specifying all the details needed for editing the content
        of XML documents in tagless mode. </p>
      <p>The framework details that are created and customized by the developer include: </p>
      <ul id="ul_qsb_q4j_mg">
        <li>The CSS stylesheet that drives the tagless visual rendering of the document.</li>
        <li>The rules for associating an XML schema with the document, which is needed for content
          completion and validation of the document.</li>
        <li>Transformation scenarios for the document.</li>
        <li>XML catalogs.</li>
        <li>Custom actions available as buttons on the toolbar.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The tagless editor comes with some ready-to-use predefined document types for XML
        frameworks such as DocBook, DITA, TEI, and XHTML.</p>
