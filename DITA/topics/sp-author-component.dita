  <title>Author Component</title>
  <body>
    <p>The <i>Author Component</i> was designed as a separate product to provide the functionality
      of the standard <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode. Recently (in version 14.2), the component
      API was extended to also allow multiple edit modes like <b>Text</b> and <b>Grid</b>. The
      component can be embedded either in a third-party standalone Java application or customized as
      a Java Web Applet to provide WYSIWYG-like XML editing directly in your web browser of
      choice.</p>
    <p>The <i>Author Component</i> startup project for Java/Swing integrations is available online
      as a Maven archetype on the <ph keyref="product"/> website. More information about the setup
      can be found <xref href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/oxygen_sdk.html#oXygen_component"
