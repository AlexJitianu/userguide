    <p>This view shows a top-down call tree representing how XSLT instructions or XQuery expressions
      are processed.</p>

    <p>The entries in the invocation tree have different meanings which are indicated by the
      displayed icons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><uicontrol><image href="../img/PArrowDown16.png" id="image_n1n_j2n_wr"/></uicontrol> -
        Points to a call whose inherent time is insignificant compared to its total time.</li>
      <li><uicontrol><image href="../img/PClock16.png" id="image_ldh_p2n_wr"/></uicontrol> - Points
        to a call whose inherent time is significant compared to its total time (greater than 1/3rd
        of its total time).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every entry in the invocation tree has textual information attached which depends on the
        <xref href="preferences-profiler.dita">
        <uicontrol>XSLT/XQuery profiler settings</uicontrol>
      </xref>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A percentage number of total time which is calculated with respect to either the root of
        the tree or the calling instruction.</li>
      <li>A total time measurement in milliseconds or microseconds. This is the total execution time
        that includes calls into other instructions.</li>
      <li>A percentage number of inherent time which is calculated with respect to either the root
        of the tree or the calling instruction.</li>
      <li>An inherent time measurement in milliseconds or microseconds. This is the inherent
        execution time of the instruction.</li>
      <li>An invocation count which shows how often the instruction has been invoked on this
        call-path.</li>
      <li>An instruction name which contains also the attributes description.</li>
    </ul>
