    <p><b>Joining two elements</b> - You can choose to join the content of two sibling elements with
      the same name by using the <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>contextual menu</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Join elements</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> action.</p>
    <p>The same action can be triggered also in the next situations:<ul>
        <li>The cursor is located before the end position of the first element and
              <uicontrol><shortcut>(Delete)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
        <li>The cursor is located after the end position of the first element and
              <uicontrol><shortcut>(Backspace)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
        <li>The cursor is located before the start position of the second element and
              <uicontrol><shortcut>(Delete)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
        <li>The cursor is located after the start position of the second element and
              <uicontrol><shortcut>(Backspace)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>If the element has no sibling or the sibling element has a different name, an
        <uicontrol>Unwrap</uicontrol> operation will be performed automatically.</p>
    <p><b>Unwrapping the content of an element</b> - You can unwrap the content of an element by
      deleting its tags using the <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Delete element tags</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> action from the editor contextual menu.</p>
    <p>The same action can be triggered in the next situations: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The cursor is located before the start position of the element and
            <uicontrol><shortcut>(Delete)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
      <li>The cursor is located after the start position of the element and
            <uicontrol><shortcut>(Backspace)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
      <li>The cursor is located before the end position of the element and
            <uicontrol><shortcut>(Delete)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
      <li>The cursor is located after the end position of the element and
            <uicontrol><shortcut>(Backspace)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Removing all the markup of an element</b> - You can remove the markup of the current
      element and keep only the text content by highlighting the appropriate block of content and
      use the <uicontrol><image href="../img/RemoveMarkup16.gif" id="image_dbr_tph_5r"/>Remove All
        Markup</uicontrol> action that is available in the <uicontrol>Refactoring</uicontrol>
      submenu of the contextual menu<ph product="author editor"> and in the <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Document</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Markup</uicontrol>
        </menucascade> menu</ph>.</p>
    <p>When you press <uicontrol><shortcut>(Delete)</shortcut></uicontrol> or
          <uicontrol><shortcut>(Backspace)</shortcut></uicontrol> in the presented cases the element
      is unwrapped or it is joined with its sibling. If the current element is empty, the element
      tags will be deleted.</p>
    <p>When you click a marker representing the start or end tag of an element, the entire element
      is selected and numerous context specific actions are available in the various menus and <xref
        href="author-contextual-menu.dita#author-contextual-menu">the contextual menu</xref>.</p>
