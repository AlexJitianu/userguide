    <p>One of the most useful features in <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode is the content
      completion support. The fastest way to invoke it is to press <uicontrol
        conkeyref="reusable_oxygen_shortcuts_list/enter"/> or <uicontrol
        conkeyref="reusable_oxygen_shortcuts_list/ctrl_space"/> in the editor panel.</p>
    <p>The content completion window offers the following types of actions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Inserting allowed elements for the current context according to the associated
        schema.</li>
      <li>Inserting element values if such values are specified in the schema for the current
        context.</li>
      <li>Inserting new undeclared elements by entering their name in the text field.</li>
      <li>Inserting CDATA sections, comments, processing instructions.</li>
      <li>Inserting <xref href="../topics/code-templates.dita#code-templates" format="dita">code
          templates</xref>.</li>
      <li>If the <uicontrol>Show all possible elements in the content completion list</uicontrol>
        option from the <xref keyref="options_editor_edit-modes_author_schema-aware">Schema aware
          preferences page</xref> is enabled, the content completion pop-up window will present all
        the elements defined by the schema. When choosing an element from this section, the
        insertion will be performed using the schema aware smart editing features.</li>
    </ul>
    <fig>
      <title>Content Completion Window</title>
      <image href="../img/author_content_completion.png"/>
    </fig>
    <p>If you press <uicontrol><shortcut>(Enter)</shortcut></uicontrol> the displayed content
      completion window will contain as first entries the <uicontrol>Split &lt;Element
        name&gt;</uicontrol> items. Usually you can only split the closest block element to the
      caret position but if it is inside a list item, the list item will also be proposed for split.
      Selecting <uicontrol>Split &lt;Element name&gt;</uicontrol> splits the content of the
      specified element around the caret position. Thus, if the caret is positioned at the beginning
      or at the end of the element, the newly created sibling will be empty.</p>
    <p>If the caret is positioned inside a space preserve element the first choice in the content
      completion window is <uicontrol>Enter</uicontrol> which inserts a new line in the content of
      the element. If there is a selection in the editor and you invoke content completion, a
        <uicontrol>Surround with</uicontrol> operation can be performed. The tag used will be the
      selected item from the content completion window.</p>
    <p>By default you are not allowed to insert element names which are not defined by the schema.
      This can be changed by unchecking the <uicontrol>Allow only insertion of valid elements and
        attributes</uicontrol> check box from the <xref keyref="options_editor_edit-modes_author_schema-aware">Schema
        aware preferences page</xref>.<note>The content completion list of proposals contains
        elements depending on the elements inserted both before and after the caret position.
      </note></p>
    <p><b>Joining two elements</b> - You can choose to join the content of two sibling elements with
      the same name by using the <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>contextual menu</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Join elements</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> action.</p>
    <p>The same action can be triggered also in the next situations:<ul>
        <li>The caret is located before the end position of the first element and
              <uicontrol><shortcut>(Delete)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
        <li>The caret is located after the end position of the first element and
              <uicontrol><shortcut>(Backspace)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
        <li>The caret is located before the start position of the second element and
              <uicontrol><shortcut>(Delete)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
        <li>The caret is located after the start position of the second element and
              <uicontrol><shortcut>(Backspace)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>In either of the described cases, if the element has no sibling or the sibling element has a
      different name, <uicontrol>Unwrap</uicontrol> operation will be performed automatically.</p>
    <p><b>Unwrapping the content of an element</b> - You can unwrap the content of an element by
      deleting its tags using the <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Delete element tags</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> action from the editor contextual menu.</p>
    <p>The same action can be triggered in the next situations: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The caret is located before the start position of the element and
            <uicontrol><shortcut>(Delete)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
      <li>The caret is located after the start position of the element and
            <uicontrol><shortcut>(Backspace)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
      <li>The caret is located before the end position of the element and
            <uicontrol><shortcut>(Delete)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
      <li>The caret is located after the end position of the element and
            <uicontrol><shortcut>(Backspace)</shortcut></uicontrol> key is pressed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Removing all the markup of an element</b> - You can remove the markup of the current
      element and keep only the text content by highlighting the appropriate block of content and
      use the <uicontrol><image href="../img/RemoveMarkup16.gif" id="image_dbr_tph_5r"/>Remove All
        Markup</uicontrol> action that is available in the <uicontrol>Refactoring</uicontrol>
      submenu of the contextual menu<ph product="author editor"> and in the <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Document</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Markup</uicontrol>
        </menucascade> menu</ph>.</p>
    <p>When you press <uicontrol><shortcut>(Delete)</shortcut></uicontrol> or
          <uicontrol><shortcut>(Backspace)</shortcut></uicontrol> in the presented cases the element
      is unwrapped or it is joined with its sibling. If the current element is empty, the element
      tags will be deleted.</p>
    <p>When you click a marker representing the start or end tag of an element, the entire element
      is selected and numerous context specific actions are available in the various menus and <xref
        href="author-contextual-menu.dita#author-contextual-menu">the contextual menu</xref>.</p>
