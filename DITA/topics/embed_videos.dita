  <title>Adding Videos in the Output</title>

    <p><?oxy_comment_start author="Mark" timestamp="20141009T102028-0400" comment="This is not really a procedure. It is a statement of support for a partiular format in a particular output. It is not in any way specific to Oxygen. This is just DITA and HTML5. Not sure why is it included therefore. But if we wanted to do a featue compatibility matrix for output types, that is where this information should be."?>Videos
      can be included and played in all HTML5-based output formats (like <term>WebHelp</term>). For
      example, to add a YouTube video in the WebHelp output generated from a DITA topic, follow
      these steps:<ul>
        <li>edit the DITA topic to refer the video using an <codeph>object</codeph> element like in
          the following
          example:<codeblock>&lt;object outputclass="video"&gt;
  &lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/watch/v/VideoName"/&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;</codeblock></li>
        <li>execute a <term>WebHelp</term> or <term>WebHelp with Feedback</term> transformation
          scenario to obtain the output</li>
      </ul></p>
