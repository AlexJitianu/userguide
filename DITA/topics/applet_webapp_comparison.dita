  <title>Comparison Between oXygen XML Author Component and <ph keyref="webapp"/></title>
  <body>
    <p>The Author Component was designed to provide the functionality of the standard Author mode,
      which can be embedded either in a third-party standalone Java application or customized as a
      Java Web Applet to provide WYSIWYG-like XML editing directly in your web browser of
      choice.</p>
    <p><ph keyref="webapp"/> is a re-implementation of the oXygen Author user interface, based on
      JavaScript and HTML5. Its purpose is to enable XML editing and reviewing on your mobile
      devices and desktops directly in a web-browser environment. Because the interface was
      thinned-down as much as possible, the core XML processing was moved into a Java-enabled
      server.</p>
    <p>Considering the particularities of these two approaches, a number of differences can be
        observed:<table frame="all" rowsep="1" colsep="1" id="table_j1b_d5h_br">
