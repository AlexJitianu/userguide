  <title>Authentication Certificates Not Saved</title>
  <body>
    <p>If Syncro SVN Client prompts you to enter the authentication certificate, although you
      already provided it in a previous session, then you should make sure that your local machine
      user account has the necessary rights to store certificate files in the
        <term>Subversion</term> configuration folder (write access to <term>Subversion</term> folder
      and all its subfolders). Usually, it is located in the following locations:<ul>
        <li>Windows: <filepath>user's home directory\AppData\Roaming\Subversion</filepath></li>
        <li>Mac OS X and Linux: <filepath>user's home directory/.subversion</filepath></li>
      </ul></p>
