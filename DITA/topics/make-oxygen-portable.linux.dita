  <title>Making <ph keyref="product"/> Portable</title>
  <body>
    <p>To create a portable distribution of <ph keyref="product"/> that you can use from a USB
      stick, install normally and then copy the install directory to the USB drive. <note>The
          <filepath>.desktop</filepath> files created by the Linux installer will not work because
        the installation path is hard coded.</note></p>
    <p>If you installed using the all platforms archive, a copy of Java is not included on your USB
      stick. To ensure that <ph keyref="product"/> will run even on systems without the right
      version of Java installed:<ol>
        <li>Go to <xref href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html"
            format="html" scope="external"
            >http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</xref>, download and
          unpack/install Linux JRE.</li>
        <li>Place the JRE in the <filepath>[OXYGEN_DIR]</filepath> directory, as a directory named
            <filepath>jre</filepath>.<?oxy_comment_start author="Mark" timestamp="20140730T172308-0400" comment="I&apos;m really not sure what the original instructions were saying, but I think it was basically equivalent to the above. Please confirm."?></li>
