  <title>License Issues</title>
  <body>
    <p><ph keyref="webapp"/> uses a floating license mechanism, where the license key is stored on a
      server and individual users consume license seats from a common pool. In order to run
      properly, be aware that:</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_esd_1wr_1r">
        <li>in order for the licensing mechanism to run properly, your browser needs to accept
          cookies. Otherwise, <ph keyref="webapp"/> will not be loaded.</li>
        <li>each browser consumes a license. When you use multiple different browsers (for example
          Firefox and Chrome) to access the <ph keyref="webapp"/> at the same time on the same
          system, you will consume multiple licenses. However, multiple tabs in the same browser
          consume a single license.</li>
        <li>a license is released automatically after 30 minutes of inactivity. When resuming work,
          if there are no available licenses, you can still save the documents you are currently
          working on.</li>
        <li>on desktop systems you may force an immediate license release by closing all editor
          tabs.</li>
      </ul>
