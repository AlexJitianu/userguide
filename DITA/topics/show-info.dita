    <p>While you are working you often need to know which files you have changed, added, removed or
      renamed, or even which files got changed and committed by others. That's where the
        <uicontrol>Synchronize</uicontrol> action from <xref href="working-copy-view.dita"><uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view</xref> comes in handy. The <uicontrol>Working
        Copy</uicontrol> view will show you every file that has changed in any way in your working
      copy, as well as any unversioned files you may have.</p>
    <p>If you want more detailed information about a given resource you can use the
        <uicontrol>Information</uicontrol> action from the <uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view
        <xref href="working-copy-menu.dita">contextual menu</xref>. A
      dialog called <uicontrol>SVN Information</uicontrol> will pop up showing remote and local
      information regarding the resource, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>local path and repository location</li>
      <li>revision number</li>
      <li>last change author, revision and date</li>
      <li>commit comment</li>
      <li>information about locks</li>
      <li>local file status</li>
      <li>local properties status</li>
      <li>remote file status</li>
      <li>remote properties status</li>
      <li>file size, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The value of a property of the resource displayed in the dialog can be copied by right
      clicking on the property and selecting the <uicontrol>Copy</uicontrol> action.</p>
    <p>A less detailed list of information is also presented when you hover with the mouse pointer
      over a resource and the tooltip window is displayed.</p>
