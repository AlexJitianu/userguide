    <p>There are situations where you want to resolve URIs with an XML catalog:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you customized your DITA map to refer topics using URI's instead of local paths</li>
      <li>you have URI content references in your DITA topic files and you want to map them to local
        files when the map is transformed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In such situations you have to <xref href="using-XML-Catalogs.dita">add the catalog to <ph
          keyref="product"/></xref>. The
        <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> view will solve the displayed topic refs through
      the added XML catalog and also the DITA map transformations (for PDF output, for XHTML output,
      etc) will solve the URI references through the added XML catalog.</p>
