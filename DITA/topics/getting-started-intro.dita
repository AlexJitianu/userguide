    <p>When you launch <ph keyref="product"/> for the first time, you are greeted with a
        <uicontrol>Welcome</uicontrol> dialog box. It presents upcoming events, useful video
      demonstrations, helpful resources, the tip of the day, and also gives you easy access to
      recently used files and projects and to create new ones.</p>

    <p>If you do not want it to be displayed every time you launch <ph keyref="product"/>, disable
      the <uicontrol>Show at startup</uicontrol> option. To display it any time, go to <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Help</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol> Welcome</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>.</p>
    <p>This chapter is designed to help you get started using <ph keyref="product"/> as quickly as
      possible and to provide you with a variety of resources to help you get the most out of the
      application.</p>
