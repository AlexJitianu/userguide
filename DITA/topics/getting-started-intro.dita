For example, maybe a link to the working with projects section, etc., and obviously revise this descriptions to the section. This section should also be for Developer and Eclipse.
2) Maybe a reference to the Welcome screen topic should be here.
3) Add a new topic for creating a new project with links.
4) Add a new topic for creating a new document with links. Put &quot;Your First XML Document&quot; and &quot;Your First DITA Topic&quot; as children.
5) Figure out how to somehow combine DITA Authoring Guide and Author for DITA. (see notes in Notepad file)
