    <p>As in the case of the copy command, you can move several resources at once. Select the
      resources in the <xref href="working-copy-view.dita"><uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol>
        view</xref> and choose the <uicontrol>Move to</uicontrol> action from the contextual menu.
      The move command actually behaves as if a copy followed by a delete command were issued. You
      will find the moved resources at the desired destination and also at their original location,
      but marked as <term>deleted</term>.<note><term>External</term> items cannot be moved using the
          <uicontrol>Move to</uicontrol> action, because they cannot be deleted. Instead, you should
        edit the <term>svn:externals</term> property defining the <term>external</term>
      item.</note></p>
