    <p><ph keyref="product"/> supports the CSS Level 4 subject selector (currently a working draft
      at W3C <xref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/" format="html" scope="external"/>), as
      described in the <xref href="dg-subject-selector.dita#dg-subject-selector"/> topic. <ph
        keyref="product"/> also supports the <codeph>:has</codeph> relational pseudo-class that has
      similar functionality and it can match an element by taking its child elements into account.
      For more information, see <xref href="https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#relational"
        format="html" scope="external"/>.</p>
    <p>You can create conditions that take into account the structure of the matching element.</p>
    <example>For
      example:<codeblock>table:has( tbody > thead)
Unknown macro: { border}</codeblock>This will
      result in a border being drawn for the table elements that contain at least a
        <codeph>thead</codeph> element in the <codeph>tbody</codeph> element.</example>
    <note type="important">The current implementation has a known limitation. The general descendant
      selectors are taken into account as direct child selectors. For example, the following two CSS
      selectors are considered
      equivalent:<codeblock>:has(b c)</codeblock>and<codeblock>:has(> b > c)</codeblock></note>
