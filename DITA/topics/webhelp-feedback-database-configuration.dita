  <title>Database Configuration for DITA WebHelp with Feedback</title>
  <body>
    <p>In case you run the <uicontrol>webhelp-feedback</uicontrol> transformation, you need to
      configure the database that holds the user comments. The instructions for configuring the
      database are presented in the <filepath>instalation.html</filepath> file, located at
        <filepath>[DITA-map-base-dir]/out/[transtype]/oxygen-webhelp/resources</filepath>. The
        <filepath>instalation.html</filepath> file is created by the transformation process.</p>
