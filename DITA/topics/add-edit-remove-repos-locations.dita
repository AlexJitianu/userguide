        <p>Usually, team members do all of their work separately, in their own working copy, and
      must share their work. This is done using an <ph
        conref="oxygenEntitiesDictionary.dita#OxygenEntities/apacheSubversion"/> repository. <ph
        keyref="product"/> supports versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 of the SVN repository
        format.<note>SVN 1.8 FSFS-backed repositories (accessed through <codeph>file://</codeph>
        protocol) are not supported.</note></p>
        <p>Before you can begin working with a Subversion repository, define a repository location
            in the <xref href="repository-view.dita"><uicontrol>Repositories</uicontrol>
            view</xref>.</p>
        <p>To create a repository location, click the <uicontrol><image
                    href="../img/sa_svn_new_repository_button.png"/>New Repository
                Location</uicontrol> toolbar button or right click inside the view and select
                <uicontrol>New Repository Location...</uicontrol> from the popup menu. On Windows,
            the context menu can be displayed on a right click with the mouse or with the keyboard
            by pressing the special context menu key available on Windows keyboards. This action
            opens the <uicontrol>Add SVN Repository</uicontrol> dialog which prompts you for the URL
            of the repository you want to connect to. No authentication information is requested at
            the time the location is defined. It is left to the Subversion client to request the
            user and password information when it is needed. The main benefit of allowing Subversion
            to manage your password in this way is that it prompts you for a new password only when
            your password changes.</p>
        <p>Once you enter the repository URL <ph keyref="product"/> tries to contact the server and
      get the content of the repository for displaying it in the <xref href="repository-view.dita"
          ><uicontrol>Repositories</uicontrol> view</xref>. If the server does not respond in the
      timeout interval set in preferences, an error is reported. If you do not want to wait until
      the timeout expires, you can end the waiting process with the <uicontrol>
        <image href="../img/bt_stop.png"/> Stop</uicontrol> button from the toolbar of the view.</p>
        <p>To edit a repository location, click the <uicontrol><image
                    href="../img/sa_svn_edit_button.png"/>Edit Repository Location</uicontrol>
            toolbar button or right click inside the view on a repository root entry and select
                <uicontrol>Edit Repository Location...</uicontrol> from the popup menu.</p>
        <p>The <uicontrol>Edit SVN Repository</uicontrol> dialog works in the same way as the
                <uicontrol>Add SVN Repository</uicontrol> dialog. It shows the previously defined
            repositories URLs and it allows you to change them.</p>
        <p>To remove a repository location, click the <uicontrol><image
                    href="../img/sa_svn_remove_button.png"/>Remove Repository Location</uicontrol>
            toolbar button or right click inside the view on a repository entry and select
                <uicontrol>Remove Repository Location...</uicontrol> from the popup menu. A
            confirmation dialog is displayed to make sure that you do not accidentally remove
            locations.</p>
        <p>The order of the repositories can be changed in the <uicontrol>Repositories</uicontrol>
            view at any time with the two buttons on the toolbar of the view, the up arrow <image
                href="../img/sa_svn_move_up_button.png"/> and the down arrow <image
                href="../img/sa_svn_move_down_button.png"/>. For example, pressing the up arrow once
            moves up the selected repository in the list with one position.</p>
        <p>To set the reference revision number of an SVN repository right-click on the repository
            in the list displayed in the <xref href="repository-view.dita"
                    ><uicontrol>Repositories</uicontrol> view</xref> and select the
                <uicontrol>Change the Revision to Browse...</uicontrol> action. The revision number
            of the repository is used for displaying the contents of the repository when it is
            viewed in the <xref href="repository-view.dita"><uicontrol>Repositories</uicontrol>
                view</xref>. Only the files and folders that were present in the repository at the
            moment when this revision number was generated on the repository are displayed as
            contents of the repository tree. Also this revision number is used for all the file open
            operations executed directly from the <xref href="repository-view.dita"
                    ><uicontrol>Repositories</uicontrol> view</xref>.</p>
