  <title>Minifying CSS Stylesheets</title>
  <body>
    <p><term>Minification</term> (or <term>compression</term>) of a CSS document is the practice of
      removing unnecessary code without affecting the stylesheet's functionality.</p>
    <p>To minify a CSS, invoke the contextual menu anywhere in the edited document and choose the
        <uicontrol>Minify CSS...</uicontrol> action. <ph keyref="product"/> opens a dialog that
      allows you to:<ul>
        <li>set the location of the resulting CSS</li>
        <li>place each style rule on a new line</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>After pressing <uicontrol>OK</uicontrol>, <ph keyref="product"/> performs the following actions:<ul>
        <li>all spaces are normalized (all leading and trailing spaces are removed, while sequences
          of white spaces are replaced with single space characters)</li>
        <li>all comments are removed</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>The resulting CSS stylesheet gains a lot in terms of execution performance, but loses in
      terms of readability. The source CSS document is left unaffected.<note>To restore the
        readability of a minified CSS, invoke the <uicontrol>Format and Indent</uicontrol> action.
        However, this action will not recover any of the deleted comments.</note></p>
