  <body>
    <p>In the DITA standard architecture you create documents by collecting topics into maps. </p>
    <section>
      <title>DITA Maps</title>
      <p>A <xref keyref="dita_add-topic-to-map">DITA map</xref> organizes a set of topics into a
        hierarchy. In most output formats, the structure of the map becomes the structure of the
        table of contents. <ph keyref="product"/> provides support for creating and managing DITA
        maps through the <xref keyref="dita_edit-maps"><uicontrol>DITA Maps
          Manager</uicontrol></xref>. </p>
      <p>To watch a video on DITA editing and <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> view, go to
          <xref href="http://oxygenxml.com/demo/DITA_Editing.html" format="html" scope="external"/>
        and <xref href="http://oxygenxml.com/demo/DITA_Maps_Manager.html" format="html"
          scope="external"/>, respectively.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Book Maps</title>
      <p>A <xref keyref="dita_book-map">book map</xref> is a specialized type of DITA map intended
        for creating the structure of a book. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Sub-Maps</title>
      <p>You do not have to create an entire publication using a single map. It is generally good
        practice to break up a large publication into several smaller <xref keyref="dita_submaps"
          >sub-maps</xref> that are easier to manage. You can include a sub-map in a main map using
        a <codeph>mapref</codeph> element. You can reuse sub-maps in a variety of different
        publications by including them in each of the different publication's main maps. The
          <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> provides support for creating and managing
        sub-maps.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Chunking</title>
      <p>By default, many output types place a single topic on each output page. In some cases you
        may want to <xref keyref="dita_chunking">output multiple topics as a single output
          page</xref>. To support this, DITA provides the <codeph>chunk</codeph> attribute on the
          <codeph>topicref</codeph> element in a map.</p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Validating a Map</title>You should <xref href="../tasks/eppo-validate-map.dita"
        >validate your maps</xref> to make sure that the individual topics are valid and that the
      relationships between them are working. <ph keyref="product"/> provides a validation function
      for DITA maps that performs a comprehensive validation of a map and its topics. </section>
    <section><title>Opening a Map</title>There are several ways to open a DITA map and you can
      choose to open it in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> or in the XML editor. Use
      any of the following methods to open a map:<ul>
        <li>To open a sub-map in its own tab in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>, simply
          double click it (or right-click it and select <uicontrol>Open</uicontrol>).</li>
        <li>To open a map in the XML editor from the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>,
          right-click it and select <uicontrol>Open Map in Editor</uicontrol>.</li>
        <li product="author editor">If you open a file with the <filepath>.ditamap</filepath> or
            <filepath>.bookmap</filepath> extension (from the <uicontrol>Project</uicontrol> view or
          a system browser), a dialog box is opened that offers you the choice of opening it in the
          XML editor or in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>.<note>If you select the
              <uicontrol>Do not show the dialog again</uicontrol> option, it will always be opened
            in the method that you choose and you will not be asked in the future. However, you can
            reset this by selecting <uicontrol>Always ask</uicontrol> for the <uicontrol>When
              opening a map</uicontrol> option in <xref
              href="preferences-dita.dita#preferences-dita/ul_g5k_kdq_jq">the
                <uicontrol>DITA</uicontrol> preferences page</xref>.</note></li>
        <li product="author editor">To open a map in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>,
          you can right click a map file in the <uicontrol>Project</uicontrol> view and select <menucascade>

            <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>
          </menucascade>.</li>

            Manager</uicontrol>.</li>
        <li product="author editor">If you have a <term>DITA map</term> file open in the XML editor,
