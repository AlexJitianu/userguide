  <title>Working with DITA Maps</title>
  <body>
    <p>In the DITA standard architecture you create documents by collecting topics into maps. </p>
    <section>
      <title>DITA Maps</title>
      <p>A DITA map organizes a set of topics into a hierarchy. In most output formats, the
        structure of the map becomes the structure of the table of contents. <ph keyref="product"/>
        provides support for <xref href="../tasks/creating-dita-map.dita#creating-dita-map"
          >creating</xref> and <xref href="eppo-manage-map.dita#eppo-manage-map">managing DITA
          maps</xref> through the <xref href="dita-maps-manager.dita#dita-maps-manager"
            ><uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol></xref>. There are also specialized types of
        DITA maps, such as a <xref keyref="dita_book-map">book map</xref>, which is intended for
        creating the structure of a book.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Sub-Maps</title>
      <p>You do not have to create an entire publication using a single map. It is generally good
        practice to break up a large publication into several smaller <xref keyref="dita_submaps"
          >sub-maps</xref> that are easier to manage. You can reuse sub-maps in a variety of
        different publications by including them in each of the main maps. The <xref
          href="dita-maps-manager.dita#dita-maps-manager"><uicontrol>DITA Maps
          Manager</uicontrol></xref> provides support for easily creating and managing sub-maps.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Chunking DITA Maps</title>
      <p>By default, many output types place a single topic on each output page. In some cases you
        may want to <xref keyref="dita_chunking">output multiple topics as a single output page
          (also known as chunking)</xref>. To support this, <ph keyref="product"/> provides an <xref
          href="dita-edit-properties.dita#dita-edit-properties"><uicontrol>Edit
            Properties</uicontrol> dialog box</xref> that allows you to easily configure the
        attributes of a topic to control how your table of contents and topics are rendered in the
        output.</p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Validating a Map</title>You should <xref href="../tasks/eppo-validate-map.dita"
        >validate your maps</xref> to make sure that the individual topics are valid and that the
      relationships between them are working. <ph keyref="product"/> provides a validation function
      for DITA maps that performs a comprehensive validation of a map and its topics. </section>
    <section><title>Opening a Map</title>There are several ways to open a DITA map and you can
      choose to open it in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> or in the XML editor. Use
      any of the following methods to open a map:<ul>
        <li>To open a sub-map in its own tab in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>, simply
          double click it (or right-click it and select <uicontrol>Open</uicontrol>).</li>
        <li id="open-map-editor-li">To open a map in the XML editor from the <uicontrol>DITA Maps
            Manager</uicontrol>, right-click it and select <uicontrol>Open Map in
          Editor</uicontrol>.</li>
        <li product="author editor">If you open a file with the <filepath>.ditamap</filepath> or
            <filepath>.bookmap</filepath> extension (from the <uicontrol>Project</uicontrol> view or
          a system browser), a dialog box is opened that offers you the choice of opening it in the
          XML editor or in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>.<note>If you select the
              <uicontrol>Do not show the dialog again</uicontrol> option, it will always be opened
            in the method that you choose and you will not be asked in the future. However, you can
            reset this by selecting <uicontrol>Always ask</uicontrol> for the <xref

                opening a map</uicontrol> option in the <uicontrol>DITA</uicontrol> preferences
              page</xref>.</note></li>
        <li product="author editor">To open a map in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>,
          you can right click a map file in the <uicontrol>Project</uicontrol> view and select <menucascade>

            <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>

            Manager</uicontrol>.</li>
        <li product="author editor">If you have a <term>DITA map</term> file open in the XML editor,
          you can open it in the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol> by right-clicking the
          title tab and selecting <uicontrol>Open in DITA Maps Manager View</uicontrol>.</li>
