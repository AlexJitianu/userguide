    <p>In the DITA standard architecture you create documents by collecting topics into maps. </p>
    <section>
      <title>DITA Maps</title>
      <p>A <xref keyref="dita_add-topic-to-map">DITA map</xref> organizes a set of topics into a
        hierarchy. In most output formats, the structure of the map becomes the structure of the
        table of contents. <ph keyref="product"/> provides support for creating and managing DITA
        maps through the <xref keyref="dita_edit-maps"><wintitle>DITA Maps
        Manager</wintitle></xref>. </p>

      <title>Book Maps</title>
      <p>A <xref keyref="dita_book-map">book map</xref> is a specialized type of DITA map intended
        for creating the structure of a book. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Sub-Maps</title>
      <p>You do not have to create an entire publication using a single map. It is generally good
        practice to break up a large publication into several smaller <xref keyref="dita_submaps"
          >sub-maps</xref> that are easier to manage. You can include a sub-map in a main map using
        a <codeph>mapref</codeph> element. You can reuse sub-maps in a variety of different
        publications by including them in each of the different publication's main maps. The
          <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle> provides support or creating and managing
        sub-maps.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Chunking</title>
      <p>By default, many output types place a single topic on each output page. In some cases you
        may want to <xref keyref="dita_chunking">output multiple topics as a single output
          page</xref>. To support this, DITA provides the <codeph>chunk</codeph> attribute on the
          <codeph>topicref</codeph> element in a map.</p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Validating a Map</title>You should <xref href="../tasks/eppo-validate-map.dita"
        >validate your maps</xref> to make sure that the individual topics are valid and that the
      relationships between them are working. <ph keyref="product"/> provides a validation function
      for DITA maps that performs a comprehensive validation of a map and its topics. </section>
