  <title>Compatibility Issue Between Java and Certain Graphics Card Drivers</title>
  <body>
    <p>Under certain settings, a compatibility issue can appear between Java and some graphics card
      drivers, which results in the text from the editor (in <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> or
        <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> mode) being displayed garbled. In case you encounter this
      problem, update your  graphics card driver. Another possible workaround is to go to <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol> Fonts</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol> Text antialiasing</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> and set the value of <uicontrol> Text antialiasing</uicontrol> option to
        ON.<note>If this workaround does not resolve the problem, set the <uicontrol> Text
          antialiasing</uicontrol> option to other values than ON. </note>
