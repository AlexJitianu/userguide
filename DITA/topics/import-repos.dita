    <p>This is the process of taking a project and importing it into a repository so that it can be
      managed by an <ph conref="oxygenEntitiesDictionary.dita#OxygenEntities/apacheSubversion"/>
      server. If you have already been using Subversion and you have an existing working copy you
      want to use, then you will likely want to follow the procedure for <xref
        href="use-existing-working-copy.dita">using an existing working copy</xref>.</p>
    <p>This process is started from menu <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Repository</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Import</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Import Folder Content</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>. The same action is available in the <uicontrol>Repositories</uicontrol> view
      contextual menu. A dialog will ask you to select a directory that will be imported into the
      selected repository location. The complete directory tree will be imported into the repository
      including all files. The name of the imported folder will not appear in the repository, but
      only the contents of the folder will.</p>
