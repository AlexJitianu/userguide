      <title>Understanding DITA topics</title>
      <p>It is important to understand the role that a DITA topic plays in a DITA system. A DITA
        topic is not associated with a single document. It is a separate entity that can potentially
        be included in many different documents, help systems, or websites. When you write a DITA
        topic, therefore, you are not writing a book or a help systems or a website, you are writing
        an individual topic. This affects how you approach the writing task and how <ph
          keyref="product"/> works to support you as you write.</p>
      <p>Of course, most of your topics are actually related more or less strongly to other topics,
        and those relationships can affect how you write and how you handle things like links and
        reuse as you write. <ph keyref="product"/> can help you manage those relationships.
        Depending on how tightly or loosely your topics are related, you may use <ph
          keyref="product"/>'s tools (and features of DITA itself) in different ways.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The role of maps</title>
      <p>The basic way that DITA expresses the relationship between topics is through a DITA map.
        Other relationships between topics, such as cross references, generally need to be made
        between topics in the same map. DITA uses maps to determine which topics will be part of any
        output set that you create. While customized DITA solutions can use other mechanisms,
        generally DITA does not provide a way to output individual topics. Output is created from a
        map and includes the topics referenced by the map. </p>
      <p>A publication is not always represented by a single map. For instance, if you are writing a
        book, you might use a map to create each chapter, and then collect the chapters together in
        another map to create the book. If you are writing help topics, you might use a map to
        combine several DITA topics to create a single help topic, and then create another map to
        organize your help topics into a help systems. In this way, you can potentially reuse a map
        that represents a chapter or a help topic in more than one book or help system.</p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Adding your topic to a map</title><p>To add your topic to a map, you must first
        create a map. A map is an XML document, just like a topic. To create a map, choose <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>File</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>New...</uicontrol>
        </menucascade> and <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Framework templates</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>DITA Map</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>map</uicontrol>
        </menucascade> and select the type of map you want. (If in doubt, choose Map for now.) <ph
          keyref="product"/> will ask you if you want to open your map in the editor or in the
          <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle>. Most of the time, opening it in the <wintitle>DITA
          Maps Manager</wintitle> is the best choice. You can also open the map in the editor from
        the <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle> if you need to.</p><image
        href="../img/sa_dita_maps_manager_new.png" id="image_zvn_nsj_pp"/><p>The DITA Maps Manager
        presents a view of the DITA map similar to a table of contents. To add a topic to a map, you
        add a topic reference to the map using a <codeph>topicref</codeph> element. The easiest way
        to do this it to have the topic open in the editor and right-click on <uicontrol>DITA Topic
          Map</uicontrol> in the <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle> view and choose <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Append child</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Reference to the currently edited file...</uicontrol>
        </menucascade>. This brings up the <wintitle>Insert Reference</wintitle> dialogue with all
        of the required fields already filled in for you. You can fill in additional information
        here or add it to the map later. When you select <uicontrol>Insert and Close</uicontrol>, a
        reference to your topic is added to the map.</p><image
        href="../img/sa_insert_topic_ref_dialog.png" id="image_fqz_2ck_pp"/><p>If you want to see
        what the resulting map looks like in XML, save your map and then double click on
          <uicontrol>DITA Topic Map</uicontrol> in the <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle> view.
        The XML version of the map will open in the editor. </p><note>Maps have titles. The default
        title in <ph keyref="product"/> is <uicontrol>DITA Topic Map</uicontrol>, which is what is
        shown in the <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle> view. You can (and should) change the
        title by right clicking on the default title, <uicontrol>DITA Topic Map</uicontrol>, and
        selecting <uicontrol>Edit properties...</uicontrol>. In this description, however, we will
        continue to use the title <uicontrol>DITA Topic Map</uicontrol>.</note></section>
    <section>
      <title>Child topics</title>
      <p>As you add more topics to your map, you may want to make one topic the child of another
        topic. Making a topic a child of another is usually done at the map level, by making one
        topic reference the child of another. To create a child topic reference, right click on the
        parent topic in the DITA Maps Manager view and choose  <uicontrol>Append child.</uicontrol>
        You can then choose one of the following options:</p>
      <ul id="ul_vc4_rg4_pp">
        <li>
          <p><uicontrol>New topic...</uicontrol>, to create a new topic </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><uicontrol>Reference...</uicontrol>, to create a reference to an existing topic</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><uicontrol>Reference to the currently edited file...</uicontrol>, to make the file that
            is currently open in the editor the child topic </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also change the order and nesting of topics in the <wintitle>DITA Maps
          Manager</wintitle> view by selecting the topic to move, holding down the
          <uicontrol>Alt</uicontrol> key, and using the arrow keys to move it around.</p>
      <p>How your parent and child topics are organized in any particular output will depend both on
        the configuration of those topics in the map and on the rules of the output transform that
        is applied to them. Don't assume that your topics have to have the same organization in all
        outputs. Only the map defines the organization of the topics, not the topics themselves. It
        is perfectly possible to create different maps, with different organization and different
        configuration options, to produce different outputs. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Child maps</title>
      <p>If you have a large information set, such as a long book or an extensive help system, a
        single map can become long and difficult to manage. You can break content up into smaller
        maps. A smaller map might represent a chapter of a book, a section of a reference, or even a
        single help topic or web page made up of a number of smaller DITA topics.</p>
      <p>To build a publication out of these smaller maps, you must add them to a map that
        represents the overall publication. To add a child map to the current map, right click on
        the map title ( <uicontrol>DITA Topic Map</uicontrol>, by default) and choose <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Append child</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Map reference...</uicontrol>
        </menucascade>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Validating a map</title>
      <p>Just as you should validate your topics, you should validate your maps. <ph
          keyref="product"/> provides a validation function for DITA maps that does more than just
        validate that they are correct XML. It also: <ul id="ul_yp4_4bl_vp">
          <li>validates all of the relationships described by the maps</li>
          <li>validates all the topic files</li>
          <li>validates any links expressed in the topic files</li>
        </ul>Validating the map that describes your entire publication, therefore, validates all the
        files that make up the publication and all of the relationships between them. To validate a
        map, click the <uicontrol>Validate and Check for Completeness</uicontrol> button (<image
          href="../img/bt_validate_and_check_button.png" id="image_z2b_p5n_pp"/>) in the
          <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle> view.</p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Publishing your topics</title><p>As noted above, in DITA you do not publish a
        topic by itself. To create published output, you run a DITA transformation on a map. This
        collects all the topics referenced in the map, organizes them, and produces output in a
        particular format. By default, <ph keyref="product"/> uses the transformations provided by
        the DITA Open Toolkit for publishing to a number of different output format. Your
        organization may have created different transformations, or modified the DITA Open Toolkit
        transformations. In either case, <ph keyref="product"/> manages transformations using
        transformation scenarios. </p><p>To publish a map, you must select the transformation
        scenario you want to run and set any parameters it requires. To select a transformation,
        click the <uicontrol>Configure Transformation Scenario(s)</uicontrol> button in the
          <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle> view (<image href="../img/bt_transform_config.png"
          id="image_jcs_q14_pp"/>). This brings up the <wintitle>Configure Transformation
          Scenario(s)</wintitle> dialog.</p><image href="../img/sa_scenario_list_dialog_ditamap.png"
        id="image_o3f_tb4_pp"/></section>
    <p>Choose the transformation (or transformations) you want to apply and click <uicontrol>Apply
        associated</uicontrol>. Depending on how the transformation scenario is configured, your
      output may be opened in the appropriate application automatically. To change how a
      transformation is configured (or just to figure out where this transformation places its
      output), select the transformation and press <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol>.</p>
