  <title>Drag and Drop Without Initial Selection Does Not Work</title>
  <body>
    <section>
      <p>When I try to drag with the mouse an unselected file from the
          <uicontrol>Project</uicontrol> view<ph product="author editor"> or the <uicontrol>DITA
            Maps Manager</uicontrol> view</ph>, the drag never starts, it only selects the resource.
        I need to drag the resource again after it becomes selected. As a result any drag and drop
        without initial selection becomes a two step operation. How can I fix this?</p>
