  <title>Custom Validation of Ant Build Files</title>
  <body>
    <p>If you need to validate an Ant build file with a validation engine that is different from the
      built-in engine, you can configure external engines as custom Ant validation engines in the
        <ph keyref="product"/> preferences. After a custom validation engine is <xref
        href="preferences-editor-custom-validation.dita">properly configured</xref>, it can be
      applied on the current document by selecting it from the list of custom validation engines in
      the <uicontrol><image href="../img/bt_validation20.png" id="image_k4v_1d3_2r"
        />Validation</uicontrol> toolbar drop-down list. The document is validated against the
      schema declared in the document.</p>
