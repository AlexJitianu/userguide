    <p>The <uicontrol>Compare Directories</uicontrol> tool allows you to compare and manage changes
      to files and folders within the structure of your directories.  <ph
        product="author developer editor">The utility is available from the
          <uicontrol>Tools</uicontrol> menu or can be opened as a stand-alone application from the
          <ph keyref="product"/> installation folder (<filepath>diffDirs.exe</filepath>).</ph>
      <ph product="svnClient">The utility is available as a stand-alone application and can be
        opened from the Syncro SVN Client installation folder
        (<filepath>diffDirs.exe</filepath>).</ph>
    </p>
    <p>The directories comparison results are presented as a tree of files and directories. The
      directories and folders that contain files that differ are expanded automatically so that you
      can focus directly on the differences. You can merge the contents of the directories by using
      the copy actions. If you double-click (or press
        <uicontrol><shortcut>Enter</shortcut></uicontrol>) on a line with a pair of files, <ph
        keyref="product"/> starts a <xref href="file-comparison.dita#file-comparison" format="dita"
        >file comparison</xref> between the two files, using the <uicontrol>Compare
        Files</uicontrol> tool.<note>The comparison is only available for file type associations
        that are known by <ph keyref="product"/>.</note></p>
