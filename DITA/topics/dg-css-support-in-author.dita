  <body>
    <p><uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> editing mode supports most CSS 2.1 selectors, a lot of CSS 2.1
      properties and a few CSS 3 selectors. Also some custom functions and properties that extend
      the W3C CSS specification and are useful for URL and string manipulation are available to the
      developer who creates an Author editing framework.</p>
