    <title>Special Characters Are Replaced With a Square in Editor</title>
    <body>
        <section>
            <p>My file was created with other application and it contains special characters like é,
                ©, ®, etc. Why does <ph
                    keyref="product"/>
                display a square for these characters when I open the file in <ph 
                    keyref="product"/>?</p>

            <p>You must set a font able to render the special characters in the <xref
                    href="preferences-fonts.dita"><uicontrol>Font</uicontrol> preferences</xref>. If
                it is a text file you must set also <xref href="preferences-encoding.dita">the
                    encoding used for non XML files.</xref> If you want to set a font which is
                installed on your computer but that font is not accessible in the
                    <uicontrol>Font</uicontrol> preferences that means the Java virtual machine is
                not able to load the system fonts, probably because it is not a True Type font. It
                is a problem of the Java virtual machine and a possible solution is to copy the font
                file in the <filepath>[JVM-home-folder]/lib/fonts</filepath> folder.
                    <filepath>[JVM-home-folder]</filepath> is the value of the property
                    <i>java.home</i> which is available in the <uicontrol>System
                    properties</uicontrol> tab of the <uicontrol>About</uicontrol> dialog that is
                opened from menu <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol>Help</uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol>About</uicontrol>
                </menucascade>.</p>
