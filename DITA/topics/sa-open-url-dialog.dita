  <title>The Open URL Dialog</title>
  <body>
    <p>To open this dialog, go to <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>File</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Open URL ...</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> (or click the <uicontrol><image href="../img/bt_open_url.png"/>Open URL
        ...</uicontrol> toolbar button), then choose the <uicontrol><image
          href="../img/bt_open_url.png"/>Browse for remote file</uicontrol> option from the drop
      down action list.</p>

    <p>The displayed dialog is composed of several parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The <i>Identification</i> section contains the access credentials. To browse for a file
          on a server, you have to specify the user and password. This information is bound to the
          selected URL displayed in the <uicontrol>File URL</uicontrol> combo box, and used further
          in opening/saving the file. If the check box <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol> is selected, then
          the user and password are saved between editing sessions. The password is kept encrypted
          in the options file.<note>
            <p>Your password is well protected. In the case the options file is used on other
              machine by a user with a different username the password will become unreadable, since
              the encryption is username dependent. This is also true if you add URLs having user
              and password to your project.</p>
          </note></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the server combo you can specify the protocol (HTTP, HTTPS or FTP) and the host name
          or IP of the server.<note type="tip">When specifying a URL, follow these rules:<ul>
              <li>to access an FTP server, write the protocol, host, and port (if using a
                non-standard one), like <codeph>ftp://server.com</codeph> or
                  <codeph>ftp://server.com:7800/</codeph></li>
              <li>to access a WebDAV server, write the path to the directory of the WebDAV
                repository along with the protocol and the host name, like
                  <codeph>https://www.some-webdav-server.com:443/webdav-repository/</codeph></li>
            </ul><p>
              <note type="important">
                <p>Make sure that the repository directory ends in a slash "/", like
                    <codeph>https://www.some-webdav-server.com:443/webdav-repository/</codeph></p>
              </note>
            </p></note></p>
        <p>By pressing the <uicontrol>Connect</uicontrol> button the directory listing will be shown
          in the component below. If the input URL points to a SharePoint server, a dedicated
          SharePoint browsing component is presented. When <uicontrol>Autoconnect</uicontrol> is
          selected, the browse action is performed every time when you open the dialog.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The browser view:<ul>
            <li>In case you are browsing a WebDAV or FTP repository, the items are presented in a
              tree-like fashion. You can browse the directories, and make multiple selections.
              Additionally, you may use the <uicontrol>Rename</uicontrol>,
                <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol>, and <uicontrol>New Folder</uicontrol> actions to
              manage the file repository.<note>The file names are sorted in a case-insensitive
                way.</note></li>
            <li>
              <p>When you browse a SharePoint repository, a specialized component renders the
                SharePoint site content.</p>

              <p>The left side navigation area presents the SharePoint site structure in a tree-like
                fashion displaying the following node types: <term>sites</term> (<image
                  href="../img/SharePointWeb16.png"/>), <term>libraries</term>, and
                  <term>folders</term>. </p>

          </ul></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The editable combo box, in which it can be specified directly the URL to be opened or
          saved. <note type="tip">
            <p>You can type in here an URL like <filepath>http://some.site/test.xml</filepath>, in
              case the file is accessible through normal HTTP protocol, or
                <filepath>ftp://anonymous@some.site/home/test.xml</filepath> if the file is
              accessible through anonymous FTP.</p>
          </note>This combo box is also displaying the current selection when the user changes
          selection by browsing the tree of folders and files on the server.</p>
