        <p>To open the directories you want to compare, select a folder from each <uicontrol>Browse
        for local directory</uicontrol> button. The <uicontrol>Compare Directories</uicontrol> tool
      keeps track of the folders you are currently working with and those that you opened in this
      window. You can see and select them from the two drop-down menus.</p>
        <p>If you want to compare the content of two archives, you can select the archives from the
        <uicontrol>Browse for archive file</uicontrol> button.</p>
        <note type="tip" product="author developer editor">By default, the supported archives are
      not treated as directories and the comparison is not performed on the files inside them. To
      make <ph keyref="product"/> treat supported archives as directories, enable the <xref
        href="preferences-diff-dirs.dita#preferences-diff-dirs/look-in-archives"><uicontrol>Look in
          archives</uicontrol> option</xref> in the <uicontrol>Directories Comparison</uicontrol>
      preferences page.</note>
