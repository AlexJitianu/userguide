        keyref="product"/> lets you configure how <xref keyref="author.profiling">profiling and
        conditional text</xref> is shown in Author view. It has built in support for the standard
      conditional text features of DITA and DocBook, which you can customize for your own projects.
      You can also add conditional support for other XML vocabularies, including your custom
      vocabularies. <?oxy_comment_end?></p>
    <p>To configure <uicontrol>Profiling/Conditional Text</uicontrol> options, <ph
        conkeyref="reusable.menus/open-the-preferences-page"/> and go to  <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Editor</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Edit modes</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Profiling/Conditional Text</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>.</p>

      <note type="note">Please note the following when configuring this setting:<ul
          id="ul_a13_x5s_hp">
          <li>This setting is used to define how profiled elements are treated in Author view. It
            does not create profiling or conditional text attributes or values in the underlying XML
            vocabulary. It just changes how the editor displays them.</li>
          <li>This setting should be used for profiling / conditional text elements only. To change
            how other types of attributes are displayed in the text, use a CSS style sheet. </li>
          <li>If you are using the DITA XML vocabulary and a DITA Subject Scheme Map is defined in
            the root map of your document, it will be used in place of anything defined using this
            dialog.</li>
        </ul></note>
    </p>
    <p>This preferences page contains two items:<ul id="ul_vms_ksl_hp">
        <li><uicontrol>profiling attributes</uicontrol>, which allow to specify a set of allowable
          value for each profiling or conditional attribute.</li>
        <li><uicontrol>profiling condition sets</uicontrol> which allow you to specify a specific
          set of profiling attributes to be used to specify a particular build configuration for
          your content.</li>
      </ul>If you have two or more identically named entries that match the same document type, <ph
        keyref="product"/> uses the one that is positioned highest in the table. Use the
        <uicontrol>Up / Down</uicontrol> buttons to change the priority of the entries.</p>
    <p>The <uicontrol>Import from DITAVAL</uicontrol> button allows you to import profiling
      attributes from <filepath>.ditaval</filepath> files. You can merge these new profiling
      attributes with the existing ones, or replace them completely. If the imported attributes
      conflict with the existing ones, <ph keyref="product"/> displays a dialog box containing two
      tables: the first one previews the imported attributes and the second one previews the already
      defined attributes. You can choose either to keep the existing attributes or replace them with
      the imported ones.</p>
    <note>When importing profiling attributes from DITAVAL files, <ph keyref="product"/>
      automatically creates condition sets based on these files.</note>
