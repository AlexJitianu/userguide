      <title>Tracking Document Changes</title>
      <p><uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> is a way to keep track of the changes you make to a
        document. To activate track changes for the current document, either choose <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Review</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol>
        </menucascade> or click the <uicontrol><image href="../img/TrackChanges20.png"/>Track
          Changes</uicontrol> button on the <uicontrol>Review</uicontrol> toolbar. When
          <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> is enabled, your modifications are highlighted using
        a distinctive color. The name of the author who is currently making changes and the colors
        can be customized from the <xref keyref="options.track-changes">Review preferences
          page</xref>.</p>

        <title>Change Tracking in Author Mode</title>
        <image href="../img/author_track_changes.png"/>
      </fig>
      <p>When hovering over a change the tooltip displays information about the author and
        modification time. </p>
      <p><uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> highlights textual changes and also changes that you
        make to the attributes in a document. Here is the list of tracked changes:<ul>
          <li>Inserting, deleting content (text or elements)</li>
          <li>Drag and drop content (text or elements)</li>
          <li>Cutting or pasting content (text or elements)</li>
          <li>Inserting, deleting, and changing the structure of tables</li>
          <li>Inserting and editing lists and their content</li>
          <li>Inserting and deleting entities</li>
          <li>Inserting and deleting element tags</li>
          <li>Editing attributes</li>
          <li>Performing a <b>Split</b> operation</li>
          <li>Performing a <uicontrol>Surround with</uicontrol> operation</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>If the selection in the <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> view contains tracked changes and you
        are copying it, the clipboard contains the selection with all the <i>accepted</i> changes.
        This filtering is performed only if the selection is not entirely inside a tracked change.
        The changes are stored in the document as processing instructions and they do not interfere
        with validating and transforming it. For each change, the author name and the modification
        time are preserved.</p>
    </section>
    <example>
      <p>The following processing instruction is an example of how an <term>insert</term> change is
        stored in a
        document:<codeblock><codeph>&lt;?oxy_insert_start author="John Doe" timestamp="20090408T164459+0300"?>all&lt;?oxy_insert_end?></codeph></codeblock></p>
      <p>The following processing instruction is an example of how an <term>delete</term> change is
        stored in a
        document:<codeblock><codeph>&lt;?oxy_delete author="John Doe" timestamp="20090508T164459+0300" content="belong"?></codeph></codeblock></p>
    </example>
    <section>
      <note>Tracked changes are also shown in the <uicontrol>Outline</uicontrol> view. Deleted
        content is rendered with a strike through.</note>
    </section>
    <section id="author-comments">
      <title>Adding Document Comments</title>
      <p>You can associate a note or a comment to a selected area of content. Comments can highlight
        virtually any content from your document, except <i>read-only</i> text. The difference
        between such comments and change tracking is that a comment can be associated to an area of
        text without modifying or deleting the text. </p>
      <p>The actions for managing comments are <uicontrol>Add Comment</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Edit
          Comment</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Delete Comment</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Manage
          Comments</uicontrol> and are available on the <uicontrol>Review</uicontrol> toolbar and on
        the <uicontrol>Review</uicontrol> submenu of the contextual menu of the Author editor.</p>
      <note type="tip">The comments are stored in the document as processing instructions,
        containing information about the author name and the comment time:
        <codeblock outputclass="language-xml">&lt;?oxy_comment_start author="John Doe" timestamp="20090508T164459+0300" comment="Do not change this content"?>
    Important content
&lt;?oxy_comment_end?></codeblock></note>
      <p>Comments are persistent highlights with a colored background. The background color is
        customizable or can be assigned automatically by the application. This behavior can be
        controlled from the <xref keyref="options.track-changes">Review preferences page</xref>.</p>
    </section>
    <note><ph keyref="product"/> presents the tracked changes in DITA conrefs and XInclude
      fragments.</note>
