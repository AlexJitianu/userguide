  <title>Highlight Component Occurrences</title>
  <body>
    <p>When a component (for example types, elements, attributes) is found at current cursor
      position, <ph keyref="product"/> performs a search
      over the entire document to find the component declaration and all its references. When found,
      they are highlighted both in the document and in the stripe bar, at the right side of the
      document. Customizable colors are used: one for the component definition and another one for
      component references. Occurrences are displayed until another component is selected and a new
      search is performed. All occurrences are removed when you start to edit the document. </p>
    <p>This feature is set on automatic search by default and can be configured in the <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Options</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Editor</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Mark Occurrences</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> page. A search can also be triggered with the <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Search</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Search Occurrences in File </uicontrol>
        <uicontrol conref="oxygen-shortcuts-list.dita#oxygen-shortcuts-list/ctrl_shift_u_sa"/>
      </menucascade> contextual menu action. All matches are displayed in a separate tab of the
        <uicontrol>Results</uicontrol> view.</p>
