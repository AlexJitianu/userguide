  <title>Searching in File Paths</title>
  <body>
    <p>To perform a search in the file paths of your resources, open the <uicontrol>Open/Find
        Resources</uicontrol> dialog or the <uicontrol>Open/Find Resource</uicontrol> view, enable
      the <uicontrol>In file paths</uicontrol> option, and in the search field enter the terms that
      you want to search for.</p>
    <p>The <uicontrol>Open/Find Resource</uicontrol> view and dialog allows you to search for a
      resource either by its name or by its path (or by a fragment of its path).</p>
    <p>You can use wildcards when you perform such searches:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use "*" to match any sequence of characters;</li>
      <li>Use "?" to match any single character.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, if you search for <term>*-preferences-page</term> you will find all the
      resources that contain the <term>-preferences-page</term> fragment in their name. If you
      search for <term>*/samples/*.gif</term>, you will find all the <filepath>.gif</filepath>
      images from the <filepath>samples</filepath> directory.</p>
