  <title>Dictionaries Preferences</title>
  <body>
    <p>To set the Dictionaries preferences, <ph conkeyref="reusable.menus/open-the-preferences-page"
      /> and go to <menucascade>
        <uicontrol> Editor</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol> Spell Check</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol> Dictionaries</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>. This page allows you to configure the dictionaries and term lists
        (<filepath>.tdi</filepath> files) that <ph keyref="product"/> uses and to choose where to
      save new learned words.</p>
    <p>The following options are valid when <ph keyref="product"/> uses the Hunspell spell checking engine:<ul>
        <li>
          <uicontrol>Dictionaries and term lists default folder</uicontrol> - Displays the default
          location where the dictionaries and term lists that <ph keyref="product"/> uses are
          stored. </li>
        <li>
          <uicontrol>Include dictionaries and term list from</uicontrol> - Specifies a location
          where you can store dictionaries and term lists that are different from the default one.
        </li>
      </ul><note>The spell checker takes into account term lists collected both from the default and
        custom locations and the dictionaries from both are merged into a generic dictionary (for
        example, <filepath>en_UK.dat</filepath> from the default location is merged with
          <filepath>en_US.dat</filepath> from a custom location, and the result is a generic
        dictionary <filepath>en.dat</filepath>. However, if there is a generic dictionary (for
        example, <filepath>en.dat</filepath>) saved in either the default or custom location, the
        other specific dictionaries (for example, <filepath>en_UK.dat</filepath> or
          <filepath>en_US.dat</filepath>) will not be merged and the generic dictionary will simply
        be used. Also, if the additional location contains a file with the same name as one from the
        default location, the file in the additional location takes precedence over the file from
        the default location. </note><ul>
        <li>
          <uicontrol>Save learned words in the following location</uicontrol> - Specifies the target
          where the newly learned words are saved. By default, the target is the application
          preferences folder, but you can also choose a custom location.</li>
        <li id="delete-learned-words">
          <uicontrol>Delete learned words</uicontrol> - Opens the list of learned words, allowing
          you to select the items you want to remove, without deleting the dictionaries and term
          lists. </li>
      </ul></p>
