  <title>Spell Check Dictionaries Preferences</title>
  <body>
    <p>To set the Dictionaries preferences, <ph conkeyref="reusable.menus/open-the-preferences-page"
      /> and go to <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Editor</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Spell Check</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Dictionaries</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>. This page allows you to configure the dictionaries and term lists
        (<filepath>.tdi</filepath> files) that <ph keyref="product"/> uses and to choose where to
      save new learned words.</p>
    <p>The following options are valid when <ph keyref="product"/> uses the Hunspell spell checking engine:<ul>
        <li>
          <uicontrol>Dictionaries and term lists default folder</uicontrol> - Displays the default
          location where the dictionaries and term lists that <ph keyref="product"/> uses are
          stored. </li>
        <li>
          <uicontrol>Include dictionaries and term list from</uicontrol> - Selecting this option
          allows you to specify a location where you have stored dictionaries and term lists that
          you want to include, along with the default ones. </li>
      </ul><note>The spell checker takes into account dictionaries and term lists collected both
        from the default and custom locations and multiple dictionaries and term lists from the same
        language are merged into generic ones (for example, <filepath>en_UK.dic</filepath> from the
        default location is merged with <filepath>en_US.dic</filepath> from a custom location, and
        the result is that a third file is created for a generic dictionary called
          <filepath>en.dic</filepath>). However, if there is already a generic dictionary (for
        example, <filepath>en.dic</filepath>) saved in either the default or custom location, the
        other specific dictionaries (for example, <filepath>en_UK.dic</filepath> and
          <filepath>en_US.dic</filepath>) will not be merged and the existing generic dictionary
        will simply be used. Also, if the additional location contains a file with the same name as
        one from the default location, the file in the additional location takes precedence over the
        file from the default location. </note><ul>
        <li>
          <uicontrol>Save learned words in the following location</uicontrol> - Specifies the target
          where the newly learned words are saved. By default, the target is the application
          preferences folder, but you can also choose a custom location.</li>
        <li id="delete-learned-words">
          <uicontrol>Delete learned words</uicontrol> - Opens the list of learned words, allowing
          you to select the items you want to remove, without deleting the dictionaries and term
          lists. </li>
      </ul></p>
