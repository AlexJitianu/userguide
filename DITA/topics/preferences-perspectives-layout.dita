      <?oxy_comment_start author="Mark" timestamp="20140811T184948-0400" comment="I am confused by this setting. It is not clear how these perspectives settings are related to the four perspectives. It sounds like these settings apply to all of them, and yet the set of views in each perspective is different (which is what makes it a different perspecive). Also, the list of choices here overlaps with the names of the perspectives, but includes items not on this list. 

Also, it seems that the views will rearrange themselves naturally as you switch from one document type to another, whereas this make it sound like they are static and you have to manually select a new layout for different kinds of work.

I&apos;m going to need an explanation of how this works before I can explain it properly."?>Use
