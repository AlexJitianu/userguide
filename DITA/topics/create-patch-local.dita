  <title>Generating a Patch - Local Items</title>
  <body>
    <p>Based on a versioned item (already committed or scheduled for addition) in the working copy,
      you can generate patches that contain the local changes, the differences between a specific
      revision of that item and the item itself, or differences between the pristine item and
      another item from the repository. There are four options for generating a patch based upon
      local items:<fig id="fig_x4v_rpx_lr">

        <li><uicontrol>Create patch against a specific revision</uicontrol> - This type of patch
          contains changes between an old revision and the current content from the selected item
          within the working copy. </li>
        <li><uicontrol>Create patch between two revisions of an item</uicontrol> - This type of
          patch contains historical changes between two revisions of a selected item.</li>
        <li><uicontrol>Create patch between two repository items</uicontrol> - This type of patch
          contains changes between one version of the item and a specific version of another item
          (useful when working with branches).</li>
