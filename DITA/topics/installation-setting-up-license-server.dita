      <title>Determine if you need to set up a license server</title>
      <p>If you are using floating licenses for <ph keyref="product"/>, you may need to set up a
        license server. If the computers that will be using the floating licenses are on different
        network segments, you must use an <ph keyref="product"/> floating license server. A floating
        license server can be installed as one of the following: <ul id="ul_rkv_bs1_lr">
          <li>A <xref href="../tasks/floating-license-servlet-setup.dita">Java servlet</xref>.</li>
          <li>A <xref href="../tasks/floating-license-servlet-setup.dita">standalone
            process</xref>.</li>
        </ul><note><ph keyref="product"/> version 17 or higher requires a license server version 17
          or higher. License servers version 17 or higher can be used with any version of a floating
          license key.</note></p>

      <title>Activating Floating License Keys</title>
      <p>To help you comply with the <ph keyref="product"/> EULA (terms of licensing), all floating
        licenses require activation. This means that the license key will be locked to a particular
        license server deployment and no multiple uses of the same license key are possible.</p>
      <p>During the activation process, a code that uniquely identifies your license server
        deployment is sent to the <ph keyref="product"/> servers, which in turn will sign the
        license key.</p>

      <title>Split or combine license keys to work with your license servers</title>
      <p><ph id="note-split-combine-licenses">A license server can only manage one license key
          (which can cover any number of floating licenses). If you have multiple license keys for
          the same <ph keyref="product"/> version and you want to have all of them managed by the
          same server, or if you have a multiple-user floating license and you want to split it
          between two or more license servers, please contact <i>support@oxygenxml.com</i> and ask
          for a new license key.</ph></p>
