  <title>Creating DITA Maps and Topics</title>
  <body>
    <p>The basic building block for DITA information is the DITA topic. DITA provides the following
      topic types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Concept</i> - For general, conceptual information such as a description of a product or
        feature;</li>
      <li><i>Task</i> - For procedural information such as how to use a dialog;</li>
      <li><i>Reference</i> - For reference information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can organize topics into a DITA map or bookmap. A map is a hierarchy of topics. A bookmap
      supports also book divisions such as chapters and book lists such as indexes. Maps do not
      contain the content of topics, but only references to them. These are known as topic
      references. Usually the maps and bookmaps are saved on disk or in a CMS with the extension
      '.ditamap'.</p>
    <p>Maps can also contain relationship tables that establish relationships between the topics
      contained within the map. Relationship tables are also used to generate links in your
      published document.</p>
    <p>You can use your map or bookmap to generate a deliverable using an output type such as XHTML,
      PDF, HTML Help or Eclipse Help.</p>
