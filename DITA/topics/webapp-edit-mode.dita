  <title>The Edit Mode</title>
  <body>
    <p>The <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> mode in the <ph keyref="webapp"/> allows you not only to
      review a document but to also make changes to it. You also have the possibility to enable the
        <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> support and record all the edits you make.</p>
    <p>When you swipe right, the <uicontrol>Actions</uicontrol> panel is displayed at the left of
      the editing area. This panel lets you enable the track changes support, display the content
      completion list of proposals, undo/redo a change, and rename an element.</p>
    <note type="important">On Android devices the content completion list of proposals might display
        <term>undefined</term> elements. To avoid this, go to <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol> Bandwidth Management </uicontrol>
        <uicontrol> Reduce data usage</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> and select <uicontrol>OFF</uicontrol>.</note>
