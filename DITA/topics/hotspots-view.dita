    <p>By opening a hotspot instruction entry, the tree of back-traces leading to that instruction
      call are calculated and shown.</p>
    <p>Every hotspot is described by the values from the following columns: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The instruction name.</li>
      <li>The inherent time in milliseconds or microseconds of how much time has been spent in the
        hotspot together with a bar whose length is proportional to this value. All calls into this
        instruction are summed up regardless of the particular call sequence.</li>
      <li>The invocation count of the hotspot.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you click on the <uicontrol><image href="../img/Hotspot16.png" id="image_rhj_rdn_wr"
        /></uicontrol> handle on the left side of a hotspot, a tree of back-traces will be
      shown.</p>
    <p>Every entry in the backtrace tree has textual information attached to it which depends on the
        <xref href="preferences-profiler.dita"><uicontrol>XSLT/XQuery profiler
        settings</uicontrol></xref>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A percentage number which is calculated with respect either to the total time or the
        called instruction.</li>
      <li>A time measured in milliseconds or microseconds of how much time has been contributed to
        the parent hotspot on this call-path.</li>
      <li>An invocation count which shows how often the hotspot has been invoked on this
          call-path.<note>This is not the number of invocations of this instruction.</note></li>
      <li>An instruction name which contains also its attributes.</li>
    </ul>
