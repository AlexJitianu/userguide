    <p>Installation packages are supplied in compressed archives. Ensure you have installed a
      suitable archive extraction utility with which to extract the archive. The MD5 sum is
      available at <xref

      the downloaded archive with an MD5 checking tool available on your platform.<draft-comment
        author="Mark B">This does not appear to be true of all platforms. The Windows installer is
        an EXE. The Linux is a shell script. And I'm pretty sure most platforms come with support
        for the typical archive formats used on them built in, so I am not sure that this needs
        saying. If a reader downloaded a .zip file and did not know what to do with it, however,
        this topic does not give them enough information to figure it out. So this topic should
        either go away or be expanded. </draft-comment></p>
