    <p>The <uicontrol>Entities</uicontrol> view displays a list with all entities declared in the
      current document, as well as built-in ones. By default, it is located on the right side of the
      editor. <ph conkeyref="reusables-editing-modes/reopen-view"/></p>
    <p>Double-clicking one of the entities will insert it at the current cursor position. You can
      also sort entities by name and value by clicking the column headers.<fig

    <p id="entities-view-filter">The view features a filtering capability that allows you to search
      an entity by name, value, or both. Also, you can choose to display the internal or external
        entities.<note>When entering filters, you can use the <term>?</term> and <term>*</term>
        wildcards. Also, you can enter multiple filters by separating them with a comma.</note></p>
