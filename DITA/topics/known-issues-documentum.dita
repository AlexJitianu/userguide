  <title>Known Issues</title>
  <body>
    <p>The following are known issues with the <ph
        conref="../topics/oxygenEntitiesDictionary.dita#OxygenEntities/documentumCMS"/>:<ol>
        <li>Please note that there is a known problem in the UCF Client implementation for Mac OS X
          from Documentum 6.5 which prevents you from viewing or editing XML documents from the
          repository on Mac OS X. The UCF Client is the component responsible for file transfer
          between the repository and the local machine. This component is deployed automatically
          from the server. Documentum 6.6 and later versions do not exhibit this problem.<note>This
            issue was reproduced with Documentum 6.5 SP1. In Documentum 6.6 this is no longer
            reproducing.</note></li>
        <li>In order for the Documentum driver to work faster on Linux, you need to specify to the
          JVM to use a weaker random generator, instead of the very slow native implementation. This
          can be done by modifying in the <ph keyref="product"/> startup scripts (or in the
          *.vmoptions file) the system
          property:<codeblock>-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom</codeblock></li>
