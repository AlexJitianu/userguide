  <title>Your first XML Document</title>
  <body>
    <p>To create your first XML document, choose <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>File</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>New...</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>. The <xref href="../tasks/new-dialog-sa.dita#new-dialog-sa"><uicontrol>New
          Document Wizard</uicontrol></xref> is displayed:</p>
    <image href="../img/NewDocumentWizard.png" id="image_odn_xh4_y4"/>
    <p>You can either create a new XML document from scratch by choosing one of available types in
      the <uicontrol>New Document</uicontrol> folder, or you can choose to create one from a
      template by choosing a template from the <uicontrol>Global templates</uicontrol> or
        <uicontrol>Framework templates</uicontrol> folders. If you are looking for a commone
      document types such as DITA or DocBook, you will find templates for these document types in
      the <uicontrol>Framewrork templates</uicontrol> folder. If your company has created its own
      templates, your will also find them here.</p>
    <p>For some document types, you may find a number of different templates. For example, there are
      a number of different templates for different DocBook documents, and for different DITA topic
      types and maps. Choose the template that best meets your needs.</p>
    <section>
      <title>Writing your first document</title>
      <p>Depending on the type of document you choose, the <ph keyref="product"/> interface will
        change to support editing that document type. This may include new menus, new toolbar
        buttons, and new items on the context menus. </p>
      <p>Also, depending on the type of document you choose, <ph keyref="product"/> may have opened
        your document in <xref href="text-editor-specific-actions.dita#text-editor-specific-actions"
          >Text</xref> or <xref href="tagless-editor.dita#tagless-editor">Author</xref> mode. Text
        mode shows the raw XML source file. Author mode shows a graphical view of the document.
        Whether there is an Author mode view avaialble for your document type depends on what type
        you choose and whether there is an Author mode style sheet avaialble to create the Author
        view. <ph keyref="product"/> supplies default Author mode views for most of the document
        types it supports. If your company has created its own document types, it may also have
        create Author mode stylesheets for that type. However, if you chose to create a plain XML
        file, or to create one based on a schema for which <ph keyref="product"/> has not built in
        support, you will have to edit in in Text mode or create your own Author mode style sheet
        for it. </p>
      <p>You can switch back and forth between Author mode and Text mode at any time by clicking the
        buttons at the bottom right of the editor window. You won't lose any formatting when
        switching from Author to Text mode. Text and Author mode are just different views on the
        same XML document. (There is also a <xref
          href="grid-editor-introduction.dita#grid-editor-introduction">Grid mode</xref> available,
        which is useful for certain kinds of documents, particularly those that are structured like
        databases.)</p>
      <p>If you are using Author mode, you will find that it works a lot like whatever word
        processor you are used to. If you are using Text mode, you will find it works a lot like
        many typical text editors. The biggest difference you will find, if you are new to XML, is
        that XML documents have a particular structure that you have to follow. </p>

      <title>Structuring your first document</title>
      <p>Each XML document type has a particular structure that you have to follow. Some document
        types give you a lot of choices. Some give you very few. In either case, however, you need
        to make sure that your XML follows that allowed structure for the document type you are
        creating. This means:</p>
      <ul id="ul_q4x_zr4_y4">
        <li>At any given point in the document, there are only certain XML elements allowed. <ph
            keyref="product"/> helps you determine which elemets are allowed.</li>
        <li>When you create certain elemens, you may find that your text gets a red underline and
          you get a warning that you content is invalid. This is usually because the element you
          have just created requires certain other elements inside it. Your document will be invalid
          until you create those elements. (<ph keyref="product"/> will do its best to help you with
          this. If there is only one possible element that can go inside the element you just
          created, <ph keyref="product"/> will create it for you. If there is more than one
          possiblity, though, you will have to create the content yourself. </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Editing your first document</title>
      <p>Once you have completed the first draft of your document, you may need to edit it. As with
        any editor, <ph keyref="product"/> provides the normal cut, copy, and paste options as well
        as drag and drop editing. However, when you are editing an XML document, you have to make
        sure that your edits respect the structure of the XML document type. In fact, you are often
        editing the structure as well as the content of your document.</p>
      <p><ph keyref="product"/> provides many tools to help you edit your structure and to keep your
        structure correct when editing text.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Validating your first document</title>
      <p>Validation is the process of checking that an XML document obeyes the rules of its schema.
        If <ph keyref="product"/> knows how to find the schema, it will validate the document for
        you as you type. (<ph keyref="product"/> can find the schema automatically for most of the
        document types created from templates. In some cases, though, you may have to tell it how to
        find the schema.)</p>
      <p>When <ph keyref="product"/> validates as you type, there is a small bar at the right edge
        of the editor that tells you if the document is valid, and where in the document any errors
        are found. If the indicator at the top of that bar is green, your document is invalid. If
        the document is invalid, the indicator turns red and a red bar shows you where in the
        document the error was found. Click on that bar to jump to the error. Remember that
        sometimes your document is invalid simply because the structure you are creating is not
        complete yet. If <ph keyref="product"/> cannot find one of the resources it needs to
        validate a document, the validity indicator will turn yellow. </p>
      <p>You can also validate your document at any time by clicking the Validate button or choosing <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Document</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Validate...</uicontrol>
        </menucascade></p>
