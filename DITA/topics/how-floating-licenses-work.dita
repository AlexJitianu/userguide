    <p>Floating licenses are <term>pooled</term> licenses that can be shared across a group of
      users. They are most often deployed when an organization has a group of users that only
      consume a license for a minority of their working hours. The licenses are returned back into
      the license pool as soon as they are released. Other users can then immediately reuse
        them.<note>A user who runs two different distributions of <ph keyref="product"/> (for
        example Standalone and Eclipse Plugin) at the same time on the same computer, consumes a
        single license.</note></p>
    <p>The license management is done either by the <ph keyref="product"/> itself, or by the Oxygen
      license server:<ul>
        <li>If you plan to use the application on machines running in the same local network, <ph
            keyref="product"/> can manage the licenses usage by itself. Different running instances
          of <ph keyref="product"/> communicate between them, using UDP broadcast on the 59153 port,
          to the 239.255.255.255 group. The registration procedure requires you to paste the license
          key in the license registration dialog. for further details, go to <xref
            href="../tasks/named-user-license-registration.dita#named-user-license-registration"
            format="dita">Named User License Registration</xref>.</li>
        <li>If you plan to use the application on machines running in different network segments,
          use an <ph keyref="product"/> floating license server. A floating license server can be
          installed either as a <xref href="../tasks/floating-license-servlet-setup.dita">Java
            servlet</xref> or as a <xref href="../tasks/floating-license-servlet-setup.dita"
            >standalone process</xref>.</li>
      </ul></p>
