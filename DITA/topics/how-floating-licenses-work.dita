    <p>How you register to use a floating licesne will depend on how floating licenses are managed
      in your organization. </p>
    <ul id="ul_ehh_mkz_x4">
      <li>
        <p>If all the machines sharing a pool of floating licenses are on the same network segment,
          you will register your licence the same way you register a named-user licence. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the machines sharing the pool of floating licenses are on different network segments,
          someone in your company will need to <xref keyref="installation.setting-up-license-server"
            >set up a license server</xref>. Consult that person to determine if they have set up a
          license server as a standalone process or as a Java servlet as the registration process is
          different for each.</p>
