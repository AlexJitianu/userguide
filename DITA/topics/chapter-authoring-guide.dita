This is an example of how these two sections should be combined. The &quot;Validating a DITA Map&quot; topic is a task that describes how to validate a DITA Map, while the &quot;DITA Map Completeness Check&quot; topic presents the dialog box and its options. I&apos;m not sure where they will end up in the final DITA Map, but this is how topics should be profiled and linked between the two sections."?>T<?oxy_comment_end?><?oxy_comment_start author="steven_higgs" timestamp="20150616T103503+0300" comment="The &quot;Documents and Maps&quot; section has been profiled for Eclipse (author,editor).
