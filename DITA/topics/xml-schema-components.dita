  <title>XML Schema Components</title>
  <body>
    <p>A schema diagram contains a series of interconnected components. To quickly identify the
      relation between two connected components, the connection is represented as:<ul>
        <li>A thick line to identify a connection with a required component (in the following image,
            <codeph>family</codeph> is a required element).<p><image
              href="../img/XMLSchema_required_component.png"/></p></li>
        <li>A thin line to identify a connection with an optional component (in the following image,
            <codeph>email</codeph> is an optional element).<p><image
              href="../img/XMLSchema_optional_component.png"/></p></li>
      </ul>The following topics explain in detail all available components and their symbols as they
      appear in an XML schema diagram.</p>
