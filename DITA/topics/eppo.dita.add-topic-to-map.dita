  <title>Adding Topics to a DITA Map</title>
  <body>
    <p>When you are working in DITA, there are two approaches that you can use to create
      <?oxy_comment_start author="radu_coravu" timestamp="20150107T132510+0200" comment="I&apos;m getting the impression &quot;documents&quot; means the published output. We have lots of places in our user&apos;s manual where we use things like &quot;XML document&quot; and for me in time &quot;document&quot; has been associated more with the XML source than the destination output formats."?>documents<?oxy_comment_end?>
      out of topics and maps. You can start by creating topics first, and then assemble your
      finished topics into one or more documents by creating one or more maps, or you can start by
      creating a map and then adding new topics to it as you work. </p>
    <p>The topics-first approach is generally more appropriate if you are intending to do a lot of
      content reuse, as it encourages you to think of each topic as an independent unit that can be
      combined with other topics in various ways. The map-first approach will be more familiar to
      you if you are used to creating books or manuals as a whole. <ph keyref="product"/> supports
      both approaches.</p>
    <p>A DITA map organizes content hierarchically, so you can add a topic as a child of the map
      root or of any item already in the map. Therefore, the first step to adding a topic to a map
      is always to choose the place it will be inserted into the map. </p>

      <title>Adding Existing Topics to a Map</title>
      <p>At the XML-level, a topic is added to a map by adding a reference to the map that points to
        the topic. There are a number of different reference types that you can use. The default is
        the <codeph>topicref</codeph> element. See the DITA documentation for the full range of
        reference elements and their uses. <ph keyref="product"/> provides several different tools
        for inserting reference elements into a map:</p>
      <dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Using the Insert Reference Dialog</dt>
          <dd>The <xref keyref="dita.insert-reference-dialog">Insert Reference dialog</xref> allows
            you to create each of the different reference types and fill in the most commonly used
            attributes. You can open the Insert Reference dialog in a number of ways:<ul
              id="ul_z4z_szf_1q">
              <li>By right-clicking on an item in the current map where you want to add the
                reference, selecting <uicontrol>Append child</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Insert
                  After</uicontrol>, and selecting the type of reference to enter</li>
              <li>If the topic you want to add is currently open in the editor, you can use the same
                procedure, but select <uicontrol>Reference to the currently edited
                  file...</uicontrol></li>
              <li>By selecting an item in the map and clicking the insert reference button <image
                  href="../img/bt_insert_topic_ref.png" id="image_vzk_1bg_1q"/></li>
              <li>By selecting <uicontrol>Insert Reference...</uicontrol> from the <uicontrol>DITA
                  Maps</uicontrol> menu</li>
            </ul></dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Dragging and Dropping a File into the <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle></dt>
          <dd>You can add a topic to a DITA map by dragging and dropping the file into the
              <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle>. You can drag and drop files from any of the
              following:<ul id="ul_b1c_mbg_1q">
              <li>Your OS's file system explorer</li>
              <li>The <wintitle>Project</wintitle> view</li>
              <li>The <wintitle>Open/Find Resource</wintitle> view</li>
            </ul>Adding topics this way will not open the <wintitle>Insert Reference</wintitle>
            dialog, but you can adjust all the same properties by opening the <wintitle>Edit
              Reference</wintitle> dialog. Right-click on the reference you want to edit and choose
              <uicontrol>Edit Properties...</uicontrol>.</dd>

      <title>Adding a New Topic to a Map</title>
      <p>To add a new topic to a map:</p>
      <ol id="ol_xtr_d3g_1q">
        <li>Right-click on the place in the current map where you want to add the new topic.</li>
        <li>Select either <uicontrol>Append child</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Insert After</uicontrol>
          and then select <uicontrol>New topic...</uicontrol>.</li>
