  <title>Keep Tracking of Deleted Characters</title>
  <body>
    <p>When <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> is disabled and you delete content character by
      character, the following cases are possible:<ul>
        <li>deleting content in an existing <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> change - nothing
          happens;</li>
        <li>deleting content in an existing <uicontrol>Insert</uicontrol> change - the content is
          deleted without being marked as a deletion and the INSERT change shrinks accordingly;</li>
        <li>deleting in regular content - regular deletion. </li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>When <uicontrol>Track Changes</uicontrol> is enabled and you delete content character by
      character, the following cases are possible:<ul>
        <li> deleting content in an existing <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> change:<ul>
            <li>if the same author created the <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> change, the previous
              change is marked as deleted by the current author;</li>
            <li>if another author created the <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> change, nothing happens.
