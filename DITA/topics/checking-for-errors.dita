  <!--Proofed-->
  <body>
    <p><ph keyref="webapp"/> automatically checks the document for errors. The errors and warnings
      reported by the validation engine include problems found in the following:<ul>
        <li>The structural integrity and well-formedness of the document.</li>
        <li>A set of best practice rules (such as a maximum number of words in a paragraph).</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>To see the list of errors, tap or click the <uicontrol><image
          href="../img/oxygen_webapp_addon_errors_button.png" id="image_ozw_nyg_gr"
        />Errors</uicontrol> button  (note the red marker showing the number of errors found in the
      document). Every item in the list has a button to its right side. Tap or click that button to
      go to the location in the document where the issue was found.</p>
