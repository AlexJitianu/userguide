  <title>Checking an XML Document for Errors</title>
  <body>
    <p>oXygen XML Author WebApp automatically checks the document for errors. The errors and
      warnings reported by the validation engine cover:<ul>
        <li>the document's structural integrity and well-formedness</li>
        <li>a set of best practice rules (such as a maximum number of words in a paragraph)</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>To see the list of errors, tap or click the errors button <image
        href="../img/oxygen_webapp_addon_errors_button.png"/> (note the red marker showing the
      number of errors found in the document). Every item in the list has a button to its right
      side. Tap or click that button to go to the location in the document where the issue was
      found.</p>
