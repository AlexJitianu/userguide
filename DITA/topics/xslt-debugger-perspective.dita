        <p>The XSLT Debugger perspective (<menucascade product="developer editor">
        <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Open perspective</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>XSLT Debugger</uicontrol>
      </menucascade><menucascade product="developerEclipse editorEclipse">
        <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Open Perspective</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>&lt;oXygen/> XSLT Debugger</uicontrol>
      </menucascade>) allows you to detect problems in an XSLT transformation process by executing
      the process step by step, in a controlled environment. The workspace is organized as an
      editing area supported by special helper views. The editing area contains editor panels, <xref
        href="preferences-debugger.dita">allowing you to split it horizontally or vertically</xref>
      in a stack of XML editor panels and a stack of XSLT editor panels. The XML files and XSL files
      can be edited in <xref href="editing-xml-documents.dita#editing-xml-documents" format="dita"
        >Text mode</xref> only.</p>
        <p>The layout of the XSLT Debugger perspective is composed of the following views:<ul>
                <li> Control toolbar - Contains all actions needed in order to configure and control
                    the debug process.</li>
                <li> Source document view - Displays and allows editing of data or document oriented
                    XML files (documents).</li>
                <li> Stylesheet document view - Displays and allows editing of XSL files
          (stylesheets).</li>
                <li id="debug-output-view"> Output document view - Displays the transformed output
          that results from the input of a selected document (XML) and selected stylesheet (XSL) to
          the transformer. The result of transformation is dynamically written as the transformation
          is processed. There are three types of views for the output: a text view (with XML syntax
          highlight), an XHTML view and one text view for each xsl:result-document element used in
          the stylesheet (if it is a XSLT 2.0 / 3.0 stylesheet).</li>
                <li> Information views - Distributed in two panes, they are displaying various types
                    of information that can be used to understand the transformation process. For
                    each information type there is a corresponding tab. While running a
                    transformation, relevant events are displayed in the various information views.
                    This allows the developer to obtain a clear view of the transformation
                    progress.</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>You are able to add XPath expression automatically in the <uicontrol>XWatch</uicontrol>
            view using the <uicontrol>Watch expression</uicontrol> action from the contextual menu.
            In case you select an expression or a fragment of it and then click <uicontrol>Watch
                expression</uicontrol> in the contextual menu, the entire selection is presented in
            the <uicontrol>XWatch</uicontrol> view. Using <uicontrol>Watch expression</uicontrol>
            without selecting an expression displays the value of the attribute from the caret
            position in the <uicontrol>XWatch</uicontrol> view. Variables detected at the caret
            position are also displayed. <note>Expressions displayed in the
                    <uicontrol>XWatch</uicontrol> view are normalized (unnecessary white spaces are
                removed from the expression).</note></p>
