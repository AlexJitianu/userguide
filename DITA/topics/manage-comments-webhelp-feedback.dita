    <p>When you installed the WebHelp with Feedback system, you should have been prompted to create
      an administrator account (or a user named <userinput>administrator</userinput> was created by
      default). As an administrator, you have access to manage comments posted in your
      feedback-enabled WebHelp system. You can also manage user roles and configure notification
      options.</p>
    <p>To manage comments, user roles, or notification options, follow these steps:<ol

          the bottom of each specific topic there is a <uicontrol>Comments</uicontrol> navigation
          bar and on the right side there is a <uicontrol>Log in</uicontrol> button. Click this
          button and log in with your administrator credentials. This gives you access to an
            <uicontrol>Admin</uicontrol> button.</li>

    <note type="warning">The key used for identifying the page a comment is attached to is the
      relative file path to the output page. Since the output file and folder names mirror the
      source, any change to the file name (or its folder) in the source will affect the comments
      associated with that WebHelp page. If you change the file name or path, the comment history
      for that topic will become orphaned (a change to the topic ID does not affect the comment
      history).
