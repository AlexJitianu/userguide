    <p>As an administrator, you have access to manage comments posted in your feedback-enabled
      WebHelp system. You can also manage user roles and configure notification options.</p>
    <p>To manage comments, user roles, or notification options, follow these steps:<ol

        <li><?oxy_comment_start author="steven_higgs" timestamp="20150728T103720+0300" comment="This is an assumption, based upon Adrian&apos;s comments in EXM-31081. I need to verify that this procedure is correct once Bogdan C sends credentials to log in as admin."?>At
          the bottom of each specific topic there is a <uicontrol>Comments</uicontrol> navigation
          bar and on the right side there is a <uicontrol>Log in</uicontrol> button. Click this
          button and log in with your administrator credentials. This gives you access to an
            <uicontrol>Admin</uicontrol> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <uicontrol>Admin</uicontrol> button to display an administrative interface
          inside the topic.</li>
        <li>Use this panel to manage comments, user roles, or notification
            options.<?oxy_comment_end?><p>The following options are available:<dl>
              <dlentry>

    <note><?oxy_comment_end?>The key used for identifying the page a comment belongs to is the
      relative file path to the output page (starting from the WebHelp project root). Since the
      output file and folder names mirror the source, any change to the file name (or its folder) in
      the source will affect the comments attached to that WebHelp page. Changes to the topic ID
      does not affect the comments.</note>
