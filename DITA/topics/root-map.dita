  <title>Using a Root Map</title>
  <body>
    <p>You can set a DITA Map as a key space for all the other DITA Maps and topics that you edit in
        <ph keyref="product"/>. This DITA Map is called a <term>root map</term>. Specifying the
      correct root map assures that you encounter no validation problems when you work with keyrefs.
      All the keys that are defined in a root map are available in the maps that the root map
      imports.</p>
    <p>You can specify the root map from:<ul>
        <li><xref keyref="dita.edit-maps">the <uicontrol>DITA Maps Manager</uicontrol>
          view</xref></li>

In fact, the dialogs are included in the list under the menu items that summon them. But this is not at all obvious. The dialog boxes should have therir own topics and these links shoud point to them."?><xref

    <p>You can also click one of the key reference errors to select the root map.</p>
