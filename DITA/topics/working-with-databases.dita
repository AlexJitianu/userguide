    <p>XML is a storage and interchange format for structured data and is supported by all major
      database systems. <ph keyref="product"/> offers the means for managing the interaction with
      some of the most commonly used databases (both relational and Native XML Databases). Through
      this interaction, <ph keyref="product"/> helps users to understand browsing, querying, SQL
      execution support, content editing, importing from databases, and generating XML Schema from
      database structure.</p>
