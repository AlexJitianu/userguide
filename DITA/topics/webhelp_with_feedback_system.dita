  <title>WebHelp with Feedback System Description</title>
  <body>
    <p>WebHelp with Feedback is a form of online help system that consists of a series of web pages
      (XHTML format). Its advantages include platform independence, continuous content update, and a
      feedback mechanism that allows your authors and audience to interact with one another.</p>

    </section>
    <p>The layout of the feedback-enabled WebHelp system resembles the layout of the basic WebHelp
      and the left section is the same. However, the bottom of the right section contains a
        <uicontrol>comments</uicontrol> bar. Select <uicontrol>Log in</uicontrol> from this bar to
      authenticate as a user for the WebHelp system. If you do not have a user name, complete the
      fields in the dialog box to create a user. Under the <uicontrol>comments</uicontrol> bar, you
      can click the <uicontrol>Add New Comment</uicontrol> button to add a comment, regardless of
      whether or not you are logged in. <note><ph
