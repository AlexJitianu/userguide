  <title>Sorting a Table that Contains Merged Cells</title>
  <body>
    <p>In case a table contains cells that span over multiple rows, you can not perform the sorting
      operation over the entire table. Still, the sorting mechanism works over a selection of rows
      that do not contain <term>rowspans</term>.<note>For this type of table, the
          <uicontrol>Sort</uicontrol> dialog keeps the <uicontrol>All rows</uicontrol> option
        disabled even if you perform the sorting operation over a selection of rows.</note></p>
