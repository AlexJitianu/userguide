  <title>Final Words on Merge</title>
  <body>
    <section><title><term>Sub-tree Merges</term></title>It is recommended to perform a merge on the
      whole working copy (select its root directory when triggering the operation) to avoid
        <term>sub-tree mergeinfo</term>. <term>Sub-tree mergeinfo</term> is the mergeinfo recorded
      to describe a <term>sub-tree merge</term> - that is, a merge done directly to some child of a
      branch root, which might be needed in some situations. There is nothing special about
        <term>sub-tree merges</term> or <term>sub-tree mergeinfo</term> except only one important
      point to keep in mind: the complete record of merges to a branch may not be contained solely
      in the <term>mergeinfo</term> on the branch root and you may have to look to any
        <term>sub-tree mergeinfo</term> to get a full accounting. Fortunately Subversion does this
      for you and rarely will you need to concern yourself with it.</section>
    <section id="merge-from-foreign-repositories"><title>Merging from Foreign
      Repositories</title>Subversion does support merging from foreign repositories. While all merge
      source URLs must point to the same repository, the merge target working copy may come from a
      different repository than the source. However, there are some caveats. Most notably, copies
      made in the merge source will be transformed into plain additions in the merge target. Also,
      merge-tracking is not supported for merges from foreign repositories.<note>When performing
        merges from other repositories than the one of the destination working copy item, the
          <uicontrol>Ignore ancestry / Disable merge tracking</uicontrol> option will be selected
        automatically.</note></section>
    <section><title>General Merge Recommendations</title>As a recommendation, merge only into clean
      working copies, that <b>do not</b>:<ul id="ul_zgl_hpm_34">
        <li>contain modifications;</li>
        <li>have any sparse directories (all directories must be of depth
          <term>infinity</term>);</li>
        <li>contain any switched items;</li>
      </ul><note type="important">While the above is only a recommendation, it becomes mandatory
        when performing a <xref
          href="../tasks/merge-branch.dita#merge-branch/reintegrate-merge-prereq"><term>reintegrate
            merge</term></xref>. Also, trying to merge to mixed-revision working copies will
        fail.</note>
