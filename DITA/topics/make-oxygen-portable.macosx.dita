  <title>Making <ph keyref="product"/> Portable</title>
  <body>
    <p>To create a portable distribution of <ph keyref="product"/> that you can keep on an USB
      stick, follow these instruction:<ol>
        <li>Go to <xref href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/download_oxygenxml_editor.html?os=MacOSX"
            format="html" scope="external"
            >http://www.oxygenxml.com/download_oxygenxml_editor.html?os=MacOSX</xref> and download
          the MAC distribution.<note>The MAC distribution does not include Java Virtual
            Machine.</note></li>
        <li>Unpack the ZIP and copy the <filepath>license.txt</filepath> file to the unpacked
          directory.</li>
        <li>Use <ph keyref="executableMac"/> to start the application. Java will be installed
          automatically unless it is already
          installed.<?oxy_comment_start author="Mark" timestamp="20140730T172157-0400" comment="This makes it sound like Oxygen.app will install Java if it is not installed. Is there actually some behavior on the Mac that installs Java if an application needs it? And if so, why is this not mentioned in the regular install procedure?"?></li>
        <?oxy_comment_end?>
