    <p>The W3C XML specification states that a program should not continue to process an XML
      document if it finds a validation error. The reason is that XML software should be easy to
      write, and that all XML documents should be compatible. With HTML it was possible to create
      documents with lots of errors (like when you forget an end tag). One of the main reasons that
      HTML browsers are so big and incompatible, is that they have their own ways to figure out what
      a document should look like when they encounter an HTML error. With XML this should not be
      possible.</p>
    <p>However, when creating an XML document, errors are very easily introduced. When working with
      large projects or many files, the probability that errors will occur is even greater.
      Determining that your project is error-free can be time consuming and even frustrating. For
      this reason <ph keyref="product"/> provides functions that enable easy error identification
      and rapid error location.</p>
