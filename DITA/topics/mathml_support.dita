  <title>Adding MathML support in the Author Component Web Applet</title>
  <body>
    <p>By default the Author Component Web Applet project does not come with the libraries necessary
      for viewing and editing MathML equations in the Author page. You can view and edit MathML
      equations either by adding support for <xref href="mathml_support_jeuclid.dita">JEuclid</xref>
      or by adding support for <xref href="mathml_support_mathflow.dita">MathFlow</xref>.</p>
