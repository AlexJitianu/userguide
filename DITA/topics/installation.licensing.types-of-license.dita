  <title>Choosing a license type</title>
  <body>
    <p>You can use one of two license types with <ph keyref="product"/>:</p>
    <ol id="ol_xr3_j1z_x4">
      <li>A named-user license may be use by a single named user on onr or more computers. <?oxy_comment_start author="Mark" timestamp="20140730T172847-0400" comment="If a named-user license is not transferable, what does a company do when an employee leaves and a new person starts?"?>Named
        user licenses are not transferable to a new named user.
        <?oxy_comment_end?><?oxy_comment_start author="Mark" timestamp="20140730T172906-0400" comment="Is this true? I don&apos;t see the point of the text and XML license procedures if this is not so."?>If
        you order multiple named-user licenses, you will receive a single license key good of a
        specified number of named users. It is your reponsibility to keep track of the named users
        that each license is assigned to.<?oxy_comment_end?></li>
      <li>A floating license may be used by any user on any machine within a TCP/IP network.
        However, the total number of copies of <ph keyref="product"/> in use at one time must not be
        more than the number of floating licenses available. A user who runs two different
        distributions of <ph keyref="product"/> (for example Standalone and Eclipse Plugin) at the
        same time on the same computer, consumes a single floating license.</li>
