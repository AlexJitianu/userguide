    <p>Sometimes you need to know not only what was changed in a file, but also who made those
      changes. This view displays the author and the revision that changed every line in a file.
      Just click on a line in the editor panel where the file is opened to see the revision that
      edited that line last time highlighted in the <uicontrol>History view</uicontrol> and to see
      all the lines changed by that revision highlighted in the editor panel. Also the entries of
      the <uicontrol>Annotations view</uicontrol> corresponding to that revision are highlighted. So
      the <uicontrol>Annotations view</uicontrol>, the <uicontrol>History view</uicontrol> and the
      editor panel are synchronized. Clicking on a line in one of them highlights the corresponding
      lines in the other two.</p>

      <title>The Annotations View</title>

    <p>The annotations of a file are computed with the <uicontrol>Show Annotation</uicontrol> action
      available on the right click menu of <xref href="history-view.dita">the History view</xref> and
        <xref href="repository-view.dita">the Repository view</xref>.</p>
    <p>If the file has a very long history, the computation of the annotation data can take long. If
      you want only the annotations of a range of revisions you can specify the start revision and
      the end revision of the range in a dialog similar with <xref href="history-filters-dialog.dita#history-filters-dialog/figure-history-filter-dialog">the History filter
        dialog</xref> that will be displayed in <xref href="history-view.dita">the History
        view</xref>. The action is called <uicontrol>Show Annotation</uicontrol> and is available on
      the right click menu of <xref href="working-copy-view.dita">the Working Copy view</xref>.</p>
