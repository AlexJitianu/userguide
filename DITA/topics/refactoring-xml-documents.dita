  <title>Refactoring XML Documents</title>
  <body>
    <p>In the life cycle of XML documents there are instances when the XML structure needs to be
      changed to accommodate various needs. For example, when an associated schema is updated, an
      attribute may have been removed, or a new element added to the structure.</p>
    <p>These types of situations cannot be resolved with a traditional <term>Find/Replace</term>
      tool, even if the tool accepts regular expressions. The problem becomes even more complicated
      if an XML document is computed or referenced from multiple modules, since multiple resources
      need to be changed.</p>
    <p>To assist you with these types of refactoring tasks, <ph keyref="product"/> includes a
      specialized <uicontrol>XML Refactoring</uicontrol> tool that helps you manage the structure of
      your XML documents.</p>
