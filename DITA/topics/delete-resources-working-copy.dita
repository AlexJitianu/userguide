    <p>The <uicontrol><image href="../img/sa_svn_remove_button.png"/>Delete</uicontrol> action is
      available in the contextual menu of the <xref href="working-copy-view.dita"><uicontrol>Working
          Copy</uicontrol> view</xref>. When you delete an item from the working copy, it is marked
      as <term>deleted</term> (scheduled for deletion from repository upon the next commit) and
      removed from the file system. Depending on the state of each item, you are prompted to confirm
      the operation.</p>
    <note>For SVN 1.6 working copies, the delete action does not remove from the file system the
      directories under version control, it only marks them as <term>deleted</term>. This is because
      they also contain the pristine copy of that directory content. In the <xref
        href="working-copy-view.dita"><uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view</xref>, this
      behaviour is transparent as all resources have the deleted mark (<image
        href="../img/sa_svn_wc_removed.png"/>). The directories are removed from the file system
      when you <xref href="send-changes.dita">commit</xref> them to the repository.</note>
    <p>If a resource is deleted from the file system without Subversion's knowledge, the resource is
      marked as <term>missing</term> (<image href="../img/SVNWCMissing10.png"/>) in your working
      copy. You can decide what you want to do with a <term>missing</term> item:<ul>
        <li>in case of a commit, any <term>missing</term> item is first deleted automatically and
          then committed.<note>Not any <term>missing</term> item can be committed as
              <term>deleted</term>, and removed from the repository. For example, you cannot commit
            an item that no longer exists on the disk and that was scheduled for addition (<image
              href="../img/sa_svn_wc_added.png"/>) previously, since this item does not exist in the
            repository, but you can use the <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> action
          instead.</note></li>
        <li>in case you want to recover <term>missing</term> items, either <xref
            href="update-working-copy.dita">update</xref> the items themselves or one of their
          parent directories. This fetches their latest version from the repository.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>You can also delete conflicting items (file content conflicts, property conflicts,
      tree-conflicts) and Syncro SVN Client automatically marks them as resolved.<note>It is
        recommended that you resolve conflicts manually to avoid loosing any important remote
        modifications.</note></p>
    <p>Finally, you can change your mind and <xref href="revert-changes.dita">revert</xref> the
      deleted items to their initial, pristine, state.</p>
