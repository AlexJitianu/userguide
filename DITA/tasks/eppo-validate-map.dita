    <title>Validate a DITA Map</title>
  <!--Proofed-->
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>You should validate your maps regularly to make sure that your topics are valid, and
        all of the relationships between them are working. Changing one topic, image, or piece of
        metadata may create errors in references that rely on them. You may not discover these
        problems all at once. Validate your map to catch all of these kinds of problems. The longer
        you wait between validating your maps, the more difficult it may be to detect and correct
        any errors you find.</p>
      <p>To validate a map:</p>
        </context>
        <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>In the <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle>, make sure that the tab that holds your
            <term>root map</term> is selected and that the <uicontrol>Root map</uicontrol> selection
          is set either to the name of your <term>root map</term> or to <codeph>&lt;current
            map></codeph>.</cmd>
      </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Click the <uicontrol><image href="../img/ValidateAndCheck16.png"
              id="image_q3v_2vv_sr"/>Validate and Check for Completeness</uicontrol> button on the
            <wintitle>DITA Maps Manager</wintitle> toolbar. The <xref
            keyref="dita.validate-and-check-for-completeness"><wintitle>Validate and Check for
              Completeness</wintitle></xref> dialog opens.</cmd>
            </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>If you are using profiling, check the box <uicontrol>Use DITAVAL filters</uicontrol>,
          and select the appropriate options. </cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Select any other options you want to check. </cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Click <uicontrol>Check</uicontrol>.</cmd>
        <stepresult>The validator runs over the entire map. This process may take a while if the map
          is large. If there are any errors or warnings, they are displayed in separate pane. You
          can click on each error or warning to jump to the file where the problem was found. </stepresult>
