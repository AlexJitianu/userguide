  <title>Adding Images to a DITA Topic</title>
  <body>
    <p>There are four ways to add images to a DITA topic, depending on if you want to create a
      figure (with title and caption) or just insert an image inline, and on whether you want to use
      different versions of a graphic in different media. (For instance, you might want to use a
      raster format such as PNG for Web output but a vector format such as EPS for print
      output.)</p>
    <note>You must use a graphic format that is supported by the DITA output transforms (either
      those provided by the DITA Open Toolkit, or by third parties). Not all output transforms may
      support all the same media types. Consult the DITA documentation for information on which
      formats are supported.</note>
