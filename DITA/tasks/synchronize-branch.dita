  <taskbody>
    <context>While working on your own branch, other people on your team might continue to make
      important changes in the parent branch (which can be the <term>trunk</term> itself or any
      other branch). It is recommended to periodically duplicate those changes in your branch to
      make sure your changes are compatible with them. This is done by performing a
        <term>synchronize merge</term>, which will bring your branch up-to-date with any changes
      made to its ancestral parent branch since your branch was last created or synchronized.
      Subversion is aware of the history of your branch and can detect when it split away from the
      parent branch.<p>Frequently keeping your branch in sync with the parent branch helps you to
        prevent unexpected conflicts when the time comes for you to duplicate your changes back into
        the parent branch. The synchronization uses <term>merge tracking</term> to skip all those
        revisions that have already been merged, thus a sync merge can be repeated periodically to
        fetch all the latest changes of the parent branch to keep up-to-date with it.</p><p>
        <note type="important">It is recommended to synchronize the whole working copy that was
          created from the child branch (the root of the working copy), rather than just a part of
          it.</note>
      </p><p>After running the <term>synchronize merge</term>, your working copy from the child
        branch now contains new local modifications, and these edits are duplications of all of the
        changes that have happened on the <term>trunk</term> since you first created your branch. At
        this point, your private branch is now synchronized with the trunk.</p><p>To synchronize
        your branch with its parent branch, follow these steps: </p></context>
